This book takes a fresh look at Vermont&#39;s history, uncovering hidden stories, from the earliest inhabitants to present-day citizens striving to overcome adversity and be advocates for change. Native Americans struggled to maintain an identity in the state while their land and rights were disappearing. Lucy Terry Prince was the first female African American poet who rose above racism to argue her case before Vermont&#39;s governor and won. Educator and historian Cynthia Bittinger unearths these and other inspirational stories of the contributions of women, Native Americans and African Americans to Vermont&#39;s history.</p><p>Cynthia D. Bittinger is on the faculty at the Community College of Vermont, where she teaches Vermont history and previously taught a course on women in United States history. She gives lectures for Road Scholar and OSHER, the Lifelong Learning Institute of the University of Vermont. She was appointed to the Center for Research on Vermont at the University of Vermont. She is a founding member of the Vermont Women&#39;s History Project at the Vermont Historical Society. She is a commentator for Vermont Public Radio on Vermont history. Her commentaries on Grace Coolidge won the Edward R. Murrow Award. She was the executive director of the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation in Plymouth, Vermont, for eighteen years and wrote Grace Coolidge, Sudden Star, about Vermont-born Grace Goodhue Coolidge, the First Lady from 1923 to 1929. Bittinger is a graduate of Wheaton College (Massachusetts) and Teachers College, Columbia University.</p><h2>Prom Dress</h2><p>The beautiful prom dress that Robin finds in her employer&#39;s closet becomes a fatal omen as each young woman who wears it is tortured by evil forces</p><p></p><h2>The 100-Year Secret: Britain&#39;s Hidden World War II Massacre</h2><p>On May 3, 1945, the Royal Air Force attacked a fleet of ships carrying ten thousand survivors of the Neuengamme concentration camp. The war was nearly over, and the survivors had endured one of history's most hellish ordeals, only to die at the hand of their allies. <br><br>The bodies, in the striped black-and-white uniforms of camp prisoners, were soon washing ashore on the beach by the town of Timmendorf, near the Baltic port of Neustadt. Benjamin Jacobs, then twenty-five, survived by escaping the hold and clinging to wreckage. He was one of only 350 survivors, and one of the last of those. Days before, Jacobs had boarded the Cap Arcona, along with thousands of other prisoners. A commandeered luxury liner, the Cap Arcona was a dilapidated wreck. Nearby, the freighter Theilbeck, in similar condition, was also attacked. <br><br>There is reason to believe the Germans were intending to sink it themselves. Though they claimed the prisoners were headed to Sweden, the ships may have been nonfunctional. The RAF believed the ships contained escaping SS officers. Tragically, British intelligence may have known who was on the ships, which may explain why the RAF has sealed the records until 2045. This story appears in no history books-not in Germany, England, or the United States. No one tells it. So Benjamin Jacobs must. <br></p><p>It's the story no one would tell. <br>On May 3, 1945, the Royal Air Force attacked a fleet of ships carrying more than seven thousand survivors of the Neuengamme concentration camp. The war was nearly over, and the survivors had endured one of history&#x2019;s most hellish ordeals, only to die at the hands of their allies. <br>The bodies, in the striped white-and-black uniforms of camp prisoners, were soon washing ashore on the beach by the town of Timmendorf, near the Baltic port of Neustadt.

Tragically, British intelligence may have known who was on the ships, which may explain why the RAF has sealed the records until 2045. <br>In The 100-Year Secret Benjamin Jacobs collaborates with writer Eugene Pool to describe his miraculous escape from a burning transport ship that was once one of the most glamorous ocean liners of the early twentieth century, and investigates why the incident, which will have its 60th anniversary in May, 2005, appears in no history books. The governments of Germany and Great Britain continue to refuse either to discuss it or to release pertinent records,<br>The 100-Year Secret is the first complete account in English of this horrific and suppressed tragedy. It is also the first book-length description by an actual survivor. Furthermore, it contains new information about the incident, its participants, and its perpetrators not found in previous accounts. It is both the riveting personal story of a man who refused to give up, no matter what the circumstances, and an important revision of both Jewish and world history.<br><b>BENJAMIN JACOBS</b>, a concentration camp survivor, is also the author of <i>The Dentist of Auschwitz</i>. A longtime Boston area resident, he passed away in 2004. <br><br><b>EUGENE POOL</b>, a Harvard graduate, is author of two books and numerous articles for journals and newspapers, including The Boston Globe. He lives in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. <br></p><h2>Defenders of the Republic (Star Wars: The Clone Wars)</h2><p>Based on the <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i> television series, this novel follows a group of clone troopers as they rise through the ranks from cadets, to rookies, and all the way to elite ARC troopers.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>The Dice Game of Shiva: How Consciousness Creates the Universe</h2><p>In this fascinating book, Richard Smoley examines the roles God has played for us and reconciles them with what we today know through science and reason. In the process, he shows that consciousness is the underlying reality beneath everything in the universe.<br><br>In one of Hinduism&#x2019;s great myths, Shiva plays a dice game with his consort, Parvati, and loses consistently. If he is the greatest god, why does he lose? Through this story, Richard Smoley explores the interplay between consciousness, represented by Shiva, and experience, exemplified by Parvati. He draws on numerous disciplines to offer an illuminating exploration of mind and matter and a provocative understanding of consciousness, the self, and the world.</p><p>Richard Smoley is one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on mystical philosophy. A graduate of Harvard and Oxford, Richard served for eight years as editor of <i>Gnosis: A Journal of the Western Inner Traditions</i>. Currently he is executive editor of <i>The Quest</i>, the members&#x2019; journal for the Theosophical Society in America.While the subtitle could imply grandiose theorizing, Smoley (<i>Forbidden Faith</i>), the former editor of the journal <i>Gnosis</i> and a specialist in esoteric religious thought, has written a commendably modest book. In it, the sacred Vedas of Hinduism meet Western philosophers puzzling out causation, God, the nature of reality and other questions that have given philosophers and theologians of the East and West something to think about for the past few millennia. This history of thought predates contemporary neuroscience and its exciting discoveries about the relationship between brain and mind. It also reaches across the West-East spiritual divide (monotheistic, personal religion versus impersonal, nondual religious thought) to look at patterns, associations and categories that different cultures at different times have used to make sense of the world and the challenges offered by events of the world to human needs for justice and orderliness. This is a serious, almost old-fashioned history of ideas about transcendent and human thought rather than a cheesy come-on about how your thoughts can make you rich, beautiful and successful. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For at least 10,000 years, the native people hunted the buffalo and depended upon its meat and hide for their survival. But to the Indians, the buffalo was also considered sacred. They saw this abundant, powerful animal as another tribe, one that was closely related to them, and they treated it with great respect and admiration. <br><br>Here, an award-winning nonfiction team traces the history of this relationship, from its beginnings in prehistory to the present. Deftly weaving social history and science, Dorothy Hinshaw Patent discusses how European settlers slaughtered the buffalo almost to extinction, breaking the back of Indian cultures. And she shows how today, as Indians are reviving their cultures, they are also restoring buffalo herds to the land. Featuring William Munoz&#x2019;s stunning full-color photographs, supplemented with paintings by well-known artists, this book is an inspiring tale of a successful conservation effort. Author&#x2019;s note, suggestions for further reading, index.</p><p>William Munoz has an avid interest in ecology and the environment and has taken the photographs for a number of books written by Dorothy Hinshaw Patent. Mr. Munoz lives in Hamilton, Montana.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 4-8&#x2013;This beautiful, well-written book opens with the years before the Europeans came to America, discussing how the bison and Native Americans came to the New World, the importance of the animal to the survival of the Plains Indians, and the Native peoples' spiritual relationship with the buffalo. The next two chapters discuss how the arrival of the white men brought the horses that improved the hunting techniques and lives of the Native Americans, but also led to the destruction of their way of life and the near extinction of the bison. The final chapter relates the myth of the white buffalo and ties the 1994 birth of a white buffalo to the recent resurgence of interest in Native American ideas, rituals, and respect for the natural environment and the increase in buffalo populations. Each chapter opens with a retelling of a Native myth. Patent's narrative is clear and her writing is almost lyrical. Mu�oz's breathtaking color photos of bison, landscapes, and artifacts are mixed with reproductions of period art and illustrations. Although <i>The Buffalo Hunters</i> (Time-Life, 1999) covers much of the same material in greater depth, it is more suited to an older audience and is not as well written as this title. Patent's remarkable book deserves a place in every collection.<i>&#x2013;Mary Mueller, Rolla Junior High School, MO</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, Basbanes continues his adventures among the "gently mad" on an irresistible journey to the great libraries of the past -- from Alexandria to Glastonbury -- and to contemporary collections at the Vatican, Wolfenb�ttel, and erudite universities. Along the way, he drops in on eccentric book dealers and regales us with stories about unforgettable collectors, such as the gentleman who bought a rare book in 1939 "by selling bottles of his own blood."</p><p>Taking the book's grand title from the marble lions guarding the New York Public Library at 42nd Street, Basbanes both entertains and delights. And once again, as Scott Turow aptly noted, "Basbanes makes you love books, the collections he writes about, and the volume in your hand."</p></p><p><p>Nicholas A. Basbanes has worked as an award-winning investigative reporter, a literary editor, and a nationally syndicated columnist. The author of five books, he also writes a regular column for <em>Fine Books &amp; Collections</em> magazine and lectures widely on book-related issues. He and his wife, Constance, live in Massachusetts.</p>A sequel of sorts to Basbanes's earlier A Gentle Madness (on the manic nature of bookselling and book-collecting), this copious volume takes its title from the formidable lions guarding the entrance to the main branch of the New York Public Library in Manhattan. Opening with the great libraries of the past, from Alexandria to Pergamum and Glastonbury, Basbanes, former literary editor of the Worcester Sunday Telegram, segues into such venerable active libraries as those at the Vatican, Wolfenbottel and the universities of Durham, Leiden and Oxford. He visits with shrewd, sometimes eccentric book dealers who happily recount tales of bygone bibliophiles, and illustrates a variety of collections, from illuminated medieval manuscripts to volumes more valuable for who owned them than for binding or content. "I absolutely insist on keeping the same crummy look," a bookshop owner tells him proudly. "Every time I make the place too neat, business goes down." But a pathos pervades the book, for despite the huge increase in readers and book buyers, one dealer observes "a radical dismantling of high culture well under way" since the 1930s. The collector in 1939 who bought a rare book about Native American languages "by selling bottles of his own blood" has no latter-day parallel. Basbanes closes with tales of crusty benefactors like Andrew Carnegie, and interviews with librarians faced with the dilemma of too many old books that no one now wants to read. Basbanes's fund of stories will delight readers who value books for more than just a good story, have a yen for second-hand books plucked from dusty shops or look to book catalogs for suspense and excitement. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW.

This time, Aunt Buttercup is sitting on an egg for Daisy's mom, and young Daisy can't wait for her new brother or sister to be born. But when all three of Aunt Buttercup's eggs hatch, Mama's green egg doesn't! "'Some eggs just don't hatch,' said Mama Duck. 'Come and play with your cousins, Daisy.'" But Daisy doesn't want to leave Mama's egg, and helps keep it warm even when night falls, and she is cold and tired. Finally, Daisy and her mom wake up in the morning to a <i>Pip! Pip! Pip!</i> It was her little brother! "And together they watched the sun rise on Little Pip's hatching day." Young children will love the irresistible ducks (just look at that face!), and of course the fact that Daisy doesn't give up on the egg no matter what. Each of Simmons's soft, artful pictures offers an intimate perspective on Daisy's family... from the close-up comfort of the warm, feathery nest to an unusual cattail-high view of the ducks gathered around the future Pip.

Chock full of wildly eccentric and deliciously criminal characters&#x2014;including a psycho enforcer with a green thumb, a Bahamian bad man, and the beautiful, unabashedly greedy psychic Reverend Dawn&#x2014;<em>Riding the Rap</em> dazzles with Leonard&#x2019;s trademark ingenious plot turns and razor-keen dialogue. Gripping, surprising, and unforgettable, it is a crime fiction gem that any thriller writer&#x2014;from past masters John D. MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, and James M. Cain to the bestselling mystery auteurs of today&#x2014;would be thrilled to call his own.<br></p></p><p>In this sequel to <i>Pronto</i>, Harry Arno has retired from bookmaking but is still closing out some of his outstanding debts. But then his collection agent, an ex-con by the name of Bobby Deo, goes to pick up $1,800 from Chip Ganz and ends up getting hired for a hostage-taking operation (like kidnapping "in a way," Chip tells him, "only different. A lot different.") When Harry's taken by his own man, it's up to United States Marshal Raylan Givens to track him down, in the same methodically relentless fashion he tracked Harry that time he ran off to Italy. Throw in a henchman named Louis Lewis with plans of his own and an attractive young psychic named Reverend Dawn, and you've got yet another crime story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat--occasionally chuckling to yourself--straight through to the finish.

The first, a powerful fable of the immemorial conflict between the individual and society, traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world. The second, as modern as the first is ancient, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world with the arrival of aggressive European missionaries. <br>These perfectly harmonized twin dramas are informed by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul.</p><p>One of the most widely read novels from Nigeria's most famous novelist. <b>Things Fall Apart</b> is a gripping study of the problem of European colonialism in Africa. The story relates the cultural collision that occurs when Christian English missionaries arrive among the Ibos of Nigeria, bringing along their European ways of life and religion. In the novel, the Nigerian Okonkwo recognizes the cultural imperialism of the white men and tries to show his own people how their own society will fall apart if they exchange their own cultural core for that of the English.This is Chinua Achebe&#39;s classic novel, with more than two million copies sold since its first U.S. publication in 1969.

"Curry," she informs us, correctly refers to a range of dishes calling for differing blends of spices known as "masalas." Coconut, curry leaves, and mustard seeds are particularly key in the wet masalas often used by her aunt and others in Southern India. MacMillan offers intelligent substitutions, where necessary. <i>Curried Favors</i> provides detailed directions so you can comfortably try dishes such as Idli, Yogurt, Aviyals, Kichadis, and Pachadis as well as more familiar northern favorites such as Khormas and Biriyanis. Something of a mini-coffee table book, <i>Curried Favors</i> would be a good gift, thanks to its handsome presentation and MacMillan's conversational commentary.This engaging cookbook delights as it demystifies the home cooking of southern India, offering more than 100 well-tested recipes and sumptuous photographs of the food and the region. Challenging the stereotypes that Indian curries are rich and heavy, difficult to prepare, and made with hard-to-find ingredients, this book introduces the light, tropical tastes of south India with accessible ingredients and simple methods. Adapting these south Indian recipes for the average kitchen, the author familiarizes the home cook with this lesser-known cuisine. With everything from appetizers to desserts, this is an excellent introduction to Indian cooking. The author has an extraordinary talent for explaining unfamiliar cooking techniques. She reveals how easy it is to pop mustard seeds in oil, use legumes to add crunch to a dish, and create unique spice blends.

He has written for and been on staff at many magazines including "Genius," the monthly science magazine of which he was editorial director.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>Shells are beautiful, with elegant forms, surprising sculptures, refined designs and captivating colors. Shells remain intact for long periods of time, like precious metals and gems. And in fact, costly pearls are nothing more than a shell covering that the oyster builds around a foreign body that has entered its tissues. When man succeeded in producing that most noble of ceramic products, porcelain, he gave it the name of a shell, the marginella (porcellana in Italian), with its unparalleled glossy, smooth surface. And mother-of-pearl, an iridescent product from the humble abalone of our reefs, can provide an elegant touch to a simple button, and in its more precious forms provides the raw material for refined jewelry work.<br> <br>Thus, it is no wonder that little shell treasures have been found with the remains of our most distant ancestors. It is yet another indication that the Paleolithic hunters and gatherers we commonly call cavemen had aesthetic tastes quite akin to our own, as we work and play at our computers. Archaeological excavations on sites that date back to classical antiquity have revealed collections of shells that came from thousands of miles away. In ancient Rome, they came from India, along with spices, gems, perfumes, and precious cloths. At the time of the great explorations, the dwellings of the rich and cultured of Europe were filled with spectacular, exotic shells. By that time, shell collecting was no longer just an aesthetic undertaking but an homage to the first conquests of modern science.<br> <br>Thus, without knowing it, the child who stoops to collect a shell on the seashore is repeating a gesture that human beings have performed since the dawn of the evolution of our species. And why is the eye irresistibly attracted to the form of a shell? Perhaps because, while it is a part of nature, it is different from anything else found in creation. Certainly, a worm or a curled-up caterpillar takes on a spiral form, but the result is banal and arouses no curiosity. The snail&#x2019;s spiral is something unique, different, and only in modern times has science discovered its secret: it is a logarithmic spiral, a line that runs according to a rigorous mathematical relationship. No wonder it tantalizes the eye and mind.<br> <br>But many of us do not ask such difficult questions. More simply, shells bring the sea to our homes. They remind us of beautiful sunny days, the salt air, and the enthusiasm we want to relive next year, perhaps on the same beach, or maybe in a completely different place the tropics or the antipodes. For those who scuba dive, every shell evokes a particular seabed, the thrill of a new panorama discovered while exploring the blue depths. Even a simple bag of detritus, to be explored with a lens on a winter evening to reveal its little hidden treasures, takes us back to a magnificent sheer wall, adorned with sea fans, or to a special grotto, dark as night but full of promise, or above the shining splendor of that coral formation, or into the green twilight of a forest of oarweed.<br> <br>In this book, shells will be considered as travel companions, guides to exploring the marine environments that their makers, the mollusks, conquered well over 600 million years ago. To us, they will be much more than beautiful objects or alluring memories: they will help us understand and interpret the often enigmatic panoramas of the sixth continent,&#x201d; which extends from the coastline where we feel the first sprays of water to the last horizon, where the blue of the sea merges with the sky. We will briefly consider the importance of mollusks and shells to man in both the past and the present, their unwitting role in the evolution of primitive society, and in trade, art, and science. Finally, we&#x2019;ll have some practical advice on producing a collection of shells that is beautiful to look at, helpful in understanding the sea, and respectful of nature.<br></p><h2>Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting</h2><p>When children are at their best, it is easy to get along with them and enjoy them. However, when they are defiant, argumentative or disrespectful, it is easy to get wound up, to argue back, threaten, nag or shout. If this sounds like the situation in your home too much of the time, then this is the book for you.</p><p>Noel Janis-Norton is a learning and behaviour specialist with more than forty years&#39; experience helping parents and teachers on both sides of the Atlantic. She has helped tens of thousands of parents and teachers learn effective techniques that result in more cooperative, confident, motivated, self-reliant and considerate children both at home and in the classroom.<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>Many years ago I was a new and inexperienced teacher, fresh out of teachers&#x2019; college at New York University. In my ?rst post I noticed that in some classrooms the children were shouting out, ?nding excuses to get out of their seats, throwing paper airplanes across the room as soon as the teacher&#x2019;s back was turned, and ignoring the teacher&#x2019;s repeated pleas for silence. But in other classrooms the pupils were sitting where they had been told; they were concentrating and learning&#x2014;and smiling. Clearly they were enjoying school, and they were proud of what they were achieving.</p><p>I was in awe of the excellent teachers who were able to motivate and inspire. I could see that it was not a coincidence that these were also the teachers who were able to give an instruction and know that it would be carried out. Within my ?rst few days in the classroom I became painfully aware that my four years of teacher-training had taught me almost nothing about how to manage a classroom. I had learned a lot about how to teach, but the unspoken assumption of my professors had been that all I had to do was turn up, and I would be greeted by a classroom full of quiet, motivated children gazing up at me raptly with sunshiny faces, eager to soak up everything I could teach them.</p><p>I had assumed, without having given it much thought, that I would enjoy teaching and that I would be good at it. But I saw immediately that I just wasn&#x2019;t equipped for reality. The pupils in this school did not automatically respect teachers. These children did not believe that it was their job to pay attention or do their best. So during my lunch hours in the staff room I listened carefully to the conversations of the seasoned veterans, hoping to learn the secrets of their success. I approached the teachers I admired and asked them how they managed to achieve such calm, focused classrooms.</p><p>One kindly teacher tried to reassure me: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, dear. In a few years you&#x2019;ll get the hang of it.&#x201d; This did not reassure me because I was worried that unless I ?gured out how to bring order to my classroom, I wouldn&#x2019;t last a few years. One teacher, whom I frequently heard shouting at her unruly class, interrupted to give me this piece of advice: &#x201c;These children! They&#x2019;re animals! Don&#x2019;t expect too much from them, and you won&#x2019;t be disappointed.&#x201d; I knew that couldn&#x2019;t be right because there were a handful of teachers at the school who had earned the respect of their pupils. These teachers expected a great deal from their pupils, and they were not disappointed.</p><p>One teacher tried to explain: &#x201c;You just have to show them you mean business.&#x201d; This sounded promising, but it didn&#x2019;t tell me how. Another teacher told me, &#x201c;You have to show them you believe they can do good work.&#x201d; This also sounded good, but once again, I didn&#x2019;t know <i>how</i>. And another teacher told me, &#x201c;You just have to let them know who&#x2019;s boss.&#x201d; When I asked the all-important how, I was told, &#x201c;You just have to put your foot down.&#x201d; I felt like asking, &#x201c;Which foot?&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that these excellent teachers had been good at their job for so many years that they no longer had to think about how they got the results they got. They just didn&#x2019;t know how to put into words what they were doing that worked. So, sadly, they were not able to give me any useful advice.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I began carefully observing those teachers and taking detailed notes on what they did and how they did it, what they said and how they said it. From distilling and studying my notes I realized that it was not any intrinsic quality of a teacher that got the children to behave and want to learn, but certain techniques the teachers used. I ?gured I had nothing to lose, so I started using these same techniques with my class, even though I was not con?dent that I could pull it off. I hoped that with time and practice I would eventually start getting some good results.</p><p>To my intense delight, the techniques started working within days. When I started doing what those effective teachers did, the kids quickly responded to me as if I were one of those senior teachers I admired so much. Within weeks, not years as that teacher in the staff room had predicted, I started to feel con?dent that I could achieve what I set out to do.</p><p>I was amazed when other teachers started noticing. One teacher said, &#x201c;Has Frank B. been absent recently? I haven&#x2019;t had to scold him in assembly for a while,&#x201d; and another teacher replied, &#x201c;No, he hasn&#x2019;t been absent. He&#x2019;s just much quieter now. No�l&#x2019;s working her magic on him.&#x201d; Soon I found that teachers were asking me, a rank beginner, for advice on how to handle the dif? cult kids!</p><p>Then the parents started asking me for advice. They could see that I was able to get their little rebels to sit and listen and do their work in school, so surely I would know how to get them to do their homework or go to bed without a tantrum or do what they were told. I was ?attered to be asked, but as I had no children at the time I felt I had no useful advice to give these parents. All I could think of to say was, &#x201c;This is what I&#x2019;m doing in the classroom, and it&#x2019;s working. Why not try it at home?&#x201d; Within days, parents came back to me saying, &#x201c;It works!&#x201d;</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I realized that a lot of parenting is really teaching, and that anyone can learn the techniques to become a more skilled teacher, and consequently a more skilled parent. I learned that the behaviors and habits that annoy or trouble us in our children can be improved, and in many cases completely erased, once we start thinking about each problem as a teaching opportunity.</p><p>As I continued working with children, and then with parents and teachers, I learned more and more about how to help children become more cooperative, con?dent, motivated, self-reliant, and considerate. My fascination with this subject led me to further study. And as a mother, stepparent, and foster parent (and now as a grandmother) I learned even more. Over the years I learned about the effects of temperament on behavior, and how children with extreme temperaments can be helped to develop more balanced responses. I learned that many children with behavior problems are suffering from subtle and often unrecognized learning dif?culties, and that addressing the learning problems always improves behavior and attitude. I learned that chronic stress undermines a parent&#x2019;s best efforts, and what can be done to reduce stress. Gradually I put together into one comprehensive package all the techniques, skills, strategies, and principles that I could see worked. I call this method Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting and Teaching.</p><p>Over time I went from advising parents at the school gates to giving seminars, courses, and lectures. My next step was opening a center for families. Then I put what I had learned into books and CDs and DVDs so that parents who did not live near London could bene?t from these techniques. As the word spread, I started to ?ll the need by training Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting practitioners who coach parents worldwide, in person or by telephone.</p><p>Parents always tell us that their biggest frustration is having to repeat instructions numerous times before their children listen and cooperate. As you read this book, you will see that the Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting approach gives you a step-by-step method to solve this problem (and many other typical family problems). Using positive and respectful techniques, parents can guide children into the habit of cooperating the ?rst time and without a fuss most of the time.</p><p>In this book you will ?nd strategies that will transform many typical family issues&#x2014;everything from homework and music practice and sibling rivalry to cleaning up and bedtimes and mealtimes. These strategies teach children to see themselves as capable, considerate, and worthy of appreciation. This method helps parents to feel more relaxed and more con? dent in their role as parents. And it makes family life signi? cantly calmer, easier, and happier.</p><p>In the forty years that I have been consulting with parents, I have never seen these techniques fail. It gives me great pleasure to share them with you now.</p><br><br><p><b>Section One </b></p><p><b>FIVE CORE STRATEGIES FOR CREATING A CALMER, EASIER, HAPPIER FAMILY LIFE </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER 1 </b></p><p><b>WHAT MAKES MODERN PARENTING SO STRESSFUL, AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT </b></p><p><b>Changing frustration to freedom </b></p><p><i>I used to regularly shout at my children around bedtime.

Our &#x201c;to-do list&#x201d; is pages long. Yet when we cradled our newborn in our arms and looked lovingly into his eyes, we didn&#x2019;t think, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to hand you over to someone else so I can get on with all my tasks.&#x201d; Of course we wanted to nurture and spend time with our child. We envisioned a life of calm and happy parenting.</p><p>But the reality is that many of us are juggling work, children&#x2019;s schedules, volunteer commitments, managing household chores, et cetera. We have an agenda, and we&#x2019;re constantly looking ahead to see what needs to get done. When our kids aren&#x2019;t listening or doing what we ask, it is incredibly frustrating. We ?nd ourselves losing patience and feeling stressed because of all the hassle&#x2014;the repeating, reminding, negotiating, and shouting we have to do to get our kids to do all the things that need to be done each day!</p><p>Does this sound familiar? It may be that you&#x2019;ve picked up this book because you are at your wits&#x2019; end from dealing with whining, de?ance, tantrums, and disrespect or with mealtime, bedtime, or homework battles. It may be that one of your children has a relatively more extreme temperament&#x2014;more sensitive, more intense, and more in?exible&#x2014;and you are at a loss as to how to parent this child. It may be that the problems you are dealing with are quite mild, and you just want to learn positive and effective strategies to help you be the best parent you can be. Maybe your child has a diagnosed special need and you want to know how to bring out the best in him.</p><p>This book is for all of you. In this book I will give you speci? c strategies and skills to signi?cantly improve cooperation and all the other habits that you want your child to develop. I will share with you ways to make the job of parenting calmer, easier, and happier.</p><p><b>The unique challenges that modern parents face </b></p><p>Why is parenting more stressful today, and what makes our to-do lists so long? Certainly being a parent in modern times presents new and different challenges from those our parents faced. Parents experience more stress today for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Most of us don&#x2019;t have extended family living nearby to support us. There is pressure on parents to ful?ll an impossible number of roles, especially in families with two working parents&#x2014;an ever-increasing percentage. With parents working longer and longer hours, tasks such as food shopping, cleaning, and cooking are increasingly experienced as hurried and stressful.</p><p>Modern telecommunications have made it almost impossible for parents to completely switch off. Cell phones and the Internet have crept into every corner of our lives&#x2014;our homes, our cars, our purses, our pockets, and attached to our ears. On the one hand, technology makes our lives easier, and on the other hand, the communication and the pressure to respond are coming at us 24/7!</p><p>Another role that affects our stress level is that of &#x201c;family taxi driver.&#x201d; The number of enriching activities kids have available to them today is staggering, and it starts in infancy! This is an enormous shift from our parents&#x2019; generation. Everything begins earlier for kids today: football, ballet, music lessons, and even yoga can all start by age three or younger! This presents opportunity, but also stress. We want to expose our children to lots of wonderful experiences, so we are enticed by all these enriching programs. Then, as much as our child may enjoy the activity, we end up in the role of chauffeur. All this carting them back and forth in traf?c to classes and matches plays havoc with our patience and raises our stress level. We ?nd ourselves overscheduled right alongside our children.</p><p>The perceived threat of &#x201c;stranger danger&#x201d; has also drastically changed how children play and consequently our job description. In addition to our other roles, we&#x2019;ve also become &#x201c;entertainment directors.&#x201d; It used to be that when kids came home from school, they had a snack, and then they were out the door. Parents had time to get things done while the children were out with the neighborhood kids, exploring, playing hide-and-seek, climbing trees, et cetera. Kids didn&#x2019;t come home until supper. Homework either didn&#x2019;t exist or was so minimal that it wasn&#x2019;t even on parents&#x2019; radar screens. Our parents didn&#x2019;t worry about sexual predators, so kids had the freedom to explore. Now kids are playing at home more, pleading for more screen time, exercising less, wanting us to play with them or to drive them to playdates.</p><p>Given the challenges facing modern parents, it is no wonder that we feel so stressed and are driven to nagging, threatening, criticizing, and shouting to try to make sure everything gets done that needs to get done every day. It&#x2019;s unlikely that any of these stressors will be going away, so it&#x2019;s up to us to ?nd ways to reduce family stress and to guide our children to become more cooperative so that parenting can be calmer, easier, and happier.</p><p><b>Parenting: The job with no training </b></p><p>Parenting is the most important job there is. But it&#x2019;s a job for which no training is generally given beyond childbirth classes. How can it be that a job as diverse and demanding as raising children can come without training? This isn&#x2019;t a management job we can just quit when it&#x2019;s hard and our employees are annoying us! Parenting is a job we have to get up and go to every day without pay. Of course it&#x2019;s also a job that can be incredibly rewarding. And we ?nd the job of parenting the most rewarding when we feel con?dent that the way we are parenting is positively impacting our children.</p><p>When we became parents, we were suddenly thrown into the role of educators. Most of us didn&#x2019;t go to school to become teachers, yet this is the job we perform every day with our children. In fact, teaching is our main job. I&#x2019;m not talking about teaching academic subjects. I&#x2019;m talking about teaching our children th...</p></p><h2>Winston S.

The essay was first published posthumously in 1681, and from 1840 to 1971 only a generally unreliable edition has been in print. This edition provides the first dependable and easily accessible text of Hobbes's <i>Dialogue.</i> In the <i>Dialogue,</i> Hobbes sets forth his mature reflections of the relation between reason and law, reflections more "liberal" than those found in <i>Leviathan</i> and his other well-known writings. Hobbes proposes a separation of the functions of government in the interest of common sense and humaneness without visibly violating his dictum that the sharing or division of sovereignty is an absurdity. This new edition of the <i>Dialogue</i> is a significant contribution to our understanding of seventeenth-century political philosophy.<br><br>"Hobbes students are indebted to Professor Cropsey for this scholarly and accessible edition of <i>Dialogue.</i>"&#x2014;J.

Inexorably drawn to this life of solitude and physical toil, a young woman in a man&#x2019;s world, she is perhaps the strangest member of this beguiling community of drunks and eccentrics. So begins her unabating search for a place to belong and for the raw materials with which to create a home and family of her own. Yet only through time and distance does she acquire the wisdom that allows her to see the love she lived through and sometimes left behind.<br><br>By turns cattle rancher, forest ranger, outfitter, masseuse, wife and mother, Bell vividly recounts her struggle to find solid earth in which to put down roots. Brimming with careful insight and written in a spare, radiant prose, her story is a heart-wrenching ode to the rough, enormous beauty of the Western landscape and the peculiar sweetness of hard labor, to finding oneself even in isolation, to a life formed by nature, and to the redemption of love, whether given or received. <br><br>Quietly profound and moving, astonishing in its honesty, in its deep familiarity with country rarely seen so clearly, and in beauties all its own, <i>Claiming Ground </i>is a truly singular memoir.</p><p><b>Laura Bell</b>&#x2019;s work has been published in several collections, and from the Wyoming Arts Council she has received two literature fellowships as well as the Neltje Blanchan Memorial Award and the Frank Nelson Doubleday Memorial Award. She lives in Cody, Wyoming, and since 2000 has worked there for the Nature Conservancy.MIGRATION<br><br>The sheepwagon door stands open to the early dawn. There are times when sleeping inside feels little different than sleeping out like the dogs curled in their scratched beds or the sheep planted against one another across the rise. There&#x2019;s a blanket, a curve of metal roof, a shelf of books above the bed. From up in the McCullough Peaks a lone coyote yips, sharp and high. There comes an answer, closer, the voices halting at first, then unraveling slowly into a mad chorus of wavering howls. Through the doorway, I see the dogs appear and settle their haunches into the dirt. They watch out over the land, their ears shifting to the cries like antennae. When silence returns, they lower themselves to the ground, still listening.<br><br>Under the covers, my hands are still against my bones, the edge of longing too great to name or call up. I wish for a fire to be lit in the iron stove by the door. I wish for the smell of coffee, a cup warm in my hands, a voice to say my name.<br><br>A dawn wind rustles loose tin and whispers through stiff sprigs of sage, their seedheads quivering against the wind for as far as I can see into the murky light and beyond, into the empty miles. East, across the Big Horn Basin, the horizon of mountains bears up the salmon wash of morning.<br>There were nine men herding for the ranch, each with at least a thousand head of sheep in his care. Red, Grady, Murdi, Maurice, Rudy, Ed, Doug, Albert and others that came and went, all crossing the days, one by one, from their calendars. They smelled of sheep tallow, woodsmoke and kerosene, and sometimes of whiskey seeping through their pores. Some of them brought a rare beauty and grace to their work. Others, psychotic or drunk, herded because they couldn&#x2019;t find a place among people. In the three years I herded, I came to understand they were often one and the same. They wove the line between sacred and profane, never staying much to center. I came to them the observer, the adventurer, thinking myself different and holding myself apart. I came to them a young woman among old men, but what we had in common was that line.<br>. . .<br>Across the rangelands of northwest Wyoming, they herded, headed slowly for higher ground, for tender grass and air that held some scrap of moisture. Through brief summer months they hung suspended at the top of the Big Horns. Between timberline and sky, drifts of snow gave way to pools of wild sweet arnica and sheep spread across the earth like clouds run to ground. Beneath early snows of September, the herders retreated, following the sheep down to where the range was more dirt than grass and the slanting sun would give them a brief reprieve on winter. For ten months of every year the sheep and the herders moved across this corner of the map, rising and falling, their tracks a waltz driven by time and weather and the sureness of both.<br>The men were cared for by John Lewis Hopkin, the grandson of the ranch&#x2019;s original owner, and Sterling, the man who helped him during the years I herded. They tended the camps and nursed the men&#x2019;s eccentricities, becoming for them the one line of communication with the outside world. Once a week, they&#x2019;d drive out to each camp, hauling horse oats, groceries, water, mail, rifle shells, and gossip from town. The herders would try to make this visit last as long as possible. Rudy would offer up Dutch-oven biscuits and a long list of complaints, Maurice, a pot of pinto beans with ham and tortillas rolled by hand on top of the wood stove. Some would string it out with a search for some phantom sick lamb or ewe. Grady would have coffee, sometimes an excellent mutton stew, and, in the months he was sober, good conversation and a quick wit. As for me, I was a listener and a woman among men. This alone was often enough.<br><br>Once a week the camps would be tended. After the grind of the pickup engine faded in the distance, there&#x2019;d be only the sound of sheep, of wind, of our own voices speaking out loud.<br>The ranch was sprawling, reaching seventy miles across the Big Horn Basin and spilling up into the high sagebrush benches of southern Montana. It was called the Lewis Ranch and had been established by Claude Lewis, the grandson of Mormon pioneers, from the misfortunes of homesteaders during the destitute thirties. At its peak it had run twenty thousand ewes in twenty bands, but over the years half the sheep were replaced with cattle and cowboys who demanded less patience and attention. All the sheep would have been sold but for the tenaciousness of John, the only sheepman in the family once his grandfather was gone.<br><br>The skeleton of the ranch was stitched together from smaller farms and ranches along the Shoshone River and the Big Horn, with their headwaters high in the Wind and Absaroka Ranges, and the meager creeks&#x2014;Crooked, Gypsum, Dry, Whistle and Pryor&#x2014;that channeled spring melts and infrequent rains. These places held the lambing sheds, the calving corrals, the plowed fields, and they had machinery and telephones, hot showers, and kitchen tables with the imprints of forearms worn into their vinyl coverings. These were tired places with faded paint, and they worked hard for a living, but still they were connected to the tangled life of the small towns of Lovell, Cowley, Deaver and Byron. And to the Mormon Church and to bars, to Saturday night dances, to the string of human interactions on any given day that a person can take for granted.<br><br>For just two months a year, the sheepherders would be exposed to the edges of this life, and even that exacted a heavy toll. In early February, the sheep would be trailed in from their winter ranges to the Lovell lambing sheds, where they were sheared in preparation for the lambing season. The herders&#x2019; wagons would be lined up side by side along the east edge of the pens, backed up to the fence and facing the cottonwood bottom of the Big Horn River.<br><br>With neighbors only feet away and without miles to buffer them from town&#x2019;s ragged temptations, many of those quiet men unraveled. It might begin with a swig of wine offered by the Mexican shearing crew or a half pint of whiskey pulled from a ranch hand&#x2019;s pocket. Otherwise quiet men would grow loud and then disappear. Some, the younger of the old men, planned for it with enthusiasm, counting the days until they were free to go, slicking their hair back and believing that love might be found on a barstool. Days or weeks later, a rattling car would drop them off, stumbling, at their wagon, or they&#x2019;d walk the highway home in the late night. A year&#x2019;s wages could be lost in that brief, bright sparkling. The Medicine Wheel Bar, the Cactus, the Oasis, the Shoshone, the Waterhole. Drinks were bought for the bar, money given away to strangers, saddles and rifles hocked or sold. When they reached hard bottom, out of money or health or both, they would return as quiet men again, content with the peculiar confines of their lives.<br>The ranch&#x2019;s spring ranges pushed west to the McCullough Peaks and the foothills of the volcanic Absaroka Range, north along the Polecat Bench and up into the Pryor Gap country of the Dryhead Ranch, east to the uplifted limestone slabs of the Big Horn Mountains. Straight out of the sheds, the lambs too young to trail, the sheep were loaded into semis and trucked out to the spring ranges. Days before, John and Sterling would haul the herders and wagons out into the hills, miles apart from one another, and leave them to wait alone and afoot for their sheep and horse to arrive. There, the spare rangelands are brightening with new growth: Wyoming big sage, blue gramma, needle and thread, Indian ricegrass, and, scattered among the grasses, delicate evening primrose, copper mallow, and Indian paintbrush in clumps of red, fluorescent pink, and magenta. For some, these are days of sobering up, of nursing the alcoholic shakes with strong coffee, a six-pack of beer, and the company of their dogs. For all, this time seems a true reflection of the distance between them and the world.<br>. . .<br>Sheepwagons are set and leveled where the view of the country is long and generous and includes a pond or creek where the sheep can water. Like tiny ships at sea, the wagons are built to provide sturdy shelter from the elements and to hold its contents securely in place across the miles. Their rounded roofs are metal or canvas stretched across wooden bows. Above the wagon tongue is a door, split, and through it to either side a wood cookstove and cabinets. Benches run along the sides with storage beneath, and reaching across the back is a bed with more cabinets beneath and a small window behind. From the framework of the bed, a bit of plywood can be pulled out like a kitchen cutting board to serve as the table.<br><br>On this first trip out in the spring, the tender leaves the herder with a well-stocked camp and drives away. A few days, maybe a week later, the rumbling of trucks breaks the silence and along with the rumbling the rising, bleating clamor of ewes and lambs. When the trucks stop and the dust settles,<br>metal ramps are pulled down and the ewes and lambs spill to the ground and spread and roil through the tender new grass. For the rest of that day, the herder will walk the edges of this chaos with dogs and horse, bumping strays back to center until the reunions between ewes and lambs eventually bring quiet to the waning light.<br><br>The sheep give the herders purpose again, placing them back in a world where they belong. But for those few days without sheep, their world is made up of thin air and silence, a blank slate that had sent more than one new man walking back to town.<br><br>In the early fall, after the lambs have been shipped to market, the ewes are trailed from the mountain with bitter winds sweeping at their backsides and doubled up into winter bands of two thousand or more, with the bucks thrown in for breeding. There on the low-elevation winter ranges, they paw the snow for shrubby winterfat and eat the tips from sage. The toughest of the herders stay with their sheep through the hard months of November, December, and January, gathering dogs to their beds when the temperatures fall to twenty and forty below, sleeping with eggs and potatoes under the covers to keep them from freezing in the night. At Thanksgiving, John brings a turkey dinner. At Christmas, a ham and a brand-new Pendleton wool shirt, gifts from the ranch.<br>As a young woman, I found my way into the middle of these lives. I&#x2019;d come to Wyoming, twenty-two and fresh out of college, to travel with my sister and her five-month-old son while her husband worked on a paleontological dig at Natural Trap Cave on the lower reaches of the northern Big Horn Mountains. We&#x2019;d camped into Montana&#x2019;s Pryor Mountains, the Pryor Gap, and on up north to Glacier National Park but were drawn back to the ragtag, anything-goes dig site on Little Mountain, where tents and clothes and Buddhist prayer flags all flapped in the wind. I developed a crush on the head of the dig, Miles, a sinewy paleontologist who quoted poetry and sometimes brushed his teeth with a shot of Jack Daniels in the morning. On the day before I was to head back east with my sister, Miles took us up the mountain toward the Medicine Wheel to picnic with an old sheepherder, Doug, who worked for the Lewis Ranch.<br><br>He was camped at the Little Headquarters, a low-slung, one-room log cabin, with an attached shed where he kept a circus of goats, dogs and horses. As a child I&#x2019;d hidden within the pages of books, crafting my own particular fantasy of a life lived out, with mountains, horses, a cabin, animals that I alone could befriend. I later learned that most of the sheepherders, including Doug, lived this reclusive life to save themselves from the raging alcoholism that pursued them in town, but to me it seemed idyllic. I longed for it, so much so that when I went with Doug to retrieve canned drinks chilling in his spring, the words came blurting out, &#x201c;Can I stay here? Do you need any help?&#x201d;<br><br>Doug&#x2019;s cabin was one of eight line camps scattered across the midelevation benches of Little Mountain, remote country where the sheep would be held for several weeks between the drying of the spring ranges in summer&#x2019;s heat and the opening of the higher altitude Big Horn National Forest grazing allotments. John Blue Canyon road was too rough for anything but a beater sheepwagon, so years ago, the ranch had built tiny shacks and cabins, most barely big enough for bed and stove, on each of the separate ranges. The herders stayed in these while they tended their sheep in the lush feed and tedious close quarters of Little Mountain where the bands mixed easily. But when I arrived, it was summer. All the bands had gone<br>up to the top of the Big Horns, leaving Doug to tend the bucks below on Little Mountain until they could join the ewes in the fall for breeding. The country was peppered with empty cabins, any one of which could have housed my childhood dreams.<br><br>Doug was small and gray, with the twinkly blue eyes of a leprechaun and his jeans held up by rainbow suspenders. &#x201c;Well, now, I can hardly keep myself busy,&#x201d; he said in answer to my question. &#x201c;But, you know, I bet you could set up camp in the Cow Creek cabin. There&#x2019;s lots to see up here. I could give you a horse. Strawberry&#x2019;d be plumb fine for you. I&#x2019;ve got about two of everything, salt and pepper, groceries aplenty. And a rifle. You&#x2019;d need a rifle. Ever shot one?&#x201d; By the time we&#x2019;d returned with the sodas, our plans were made. When my sister and her husband left the next day, I wouldn&#x2019;t be going with them.<br><br>For the rest of that summer, I lived in the Cow Creek cabin, ten-by-twelve feet with a bed, table, wood cookstove and creek water to drink. Most afternoons, Doug would check in on me. He&#x2019;d draw crude maps on scrap paper, showing trails, a homestead cabin, an old still site. Next morning, I&#x2019;d saddle up Strawberry, a sixteen-hand red roan gelding, filling the saddlebags with lunch and a book, one map or another folded in my pocket. I hunted arrowheads out on the Honeymoon cabin point, scouted out the Bischoff cow camp on the edge of Cottonwood Canyon and explored dark, secret trails that lead down into the depths of Devil&#x2019;s Canyon.<br><br>On weekends, Miles would bounce up the seventeen miles of deeply rutted roads in his old Land Rover with wine, books, stories, an iced-down Sara Lee cheesecake. On one occasion, he arrived with Sonia, the new Big Horn County librarian, and her two children, recently migrated out from Lexington, Kentucky. She&#x2019;d unfolded from the Land Rover, a lanky, dark-headed Dane with uncontrollably curly hair and crinkly eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve<br>found you a fellow Kentuckian,&#x201d; Miles said, and our friendship was immediate, enduring long after my brassy romance with the paleontologist was over.<br>At summer&#x2019;s end, Doug rolled a Bull Durham cigarette in the crease of his jeans and encouraged me to return. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we could get you a job lambing in the winter,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve only seen a tiny piece of this whole outfit. It&#x2019;s big. I can talk to John and get you a job.&#x201d;<br><br>I laughed at the prospect, sure of a more traditional future and certain it wouldn&#x2019;t be in the lambing sheds of Wyoming. But fall was hard. I was at a loss as to how to live my life and where to dig in. I saw people with companions, homes, meaningful work, but I had no idea how to become them, how to spin that web of comfort and belonging around me. I felt alone, unmoored and unworthy.<br><br>I&#x2019;d been drawn to the racetrack, to the fog-wisped early mornings of Kentucky, the thin-skinned electricity of the thoroughbreds, the weathered coarseness and nomadic air of the track crew. I hot-walked and galloped horses in the mornings and loaded UPS trucks from a warehouse in the afternoons, living once again in my parents&#x2019; house. One day, as I stepped from the shower, my mother saw the b...</p><h2>The Winter People</h2><p>West Hall has always been a town of strange disappearances and legends.

My sister, Constance, had married the fall before and moved to Graniteville.<br><br>I was up exploring in the woods, near the Devil&#x2019;s Hand, where Papa had forbidden us to play. The trees were leafing out, making a lush green canopy overhead. The sun had warmed the soil, giving the damp woods a rich, loamy smell. Here and there beneath the beech, sugar maple, and birch trees were spring flowers: trilliums, trout lilies, and my favorite, jack-in-the-pulpit, a funny little flower with a secret: if you lift the striped hood, you&#x2019;ll find the preacher underneath. Auntie had shown me this, and taught me that you could dig up the tubers and cook them like turnips. I had just found one and was pulling back the hood, looking for the tiny figure underneath, when I heard footsteps, slow and steady, moving my way. Heavy feet dragging through the dry leaves, stumbling on roots. I wanted to run, but froze with panic, having squatted down low behind a rock just as a figure moved into the clearing.<br><br>I recognized her at once--Hester Jameson.<br><br>She&#x2019;d died two weeks before from typhoid fever. I had attended her funeral with Papa and Jacob, seen her laid to rest in the cemetery behind the church up by Cranberry Meadow. Everyone from school was there, all in Sunday best.<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s father, Erwin, ran Jameson&#x2019;s Tack and Feed Shop. He wore a black coat with frayed sleeves, and his nose was red and running. Beside him stood his wife, Cora Jameson, a heavyset woman who had a seamstress shop in town. Mrs. Jameson sobbed into a lace handkerchief, her whole body heaving and trembling.<br><br>I had been to funerals before, but never for someone my own age. Usually it was the very old or the very young. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the casket, just the right size for a girl like me. I stared at the plain wooden box until I grew dizzy, wondering what it might feel like to be laid out inside. Papa must have noticed, because he took my hand and gave it a squeeze, pulled me a little closer to him.<br><br>Reverend Ayers, a young man then, said Hester was with the angels. Our old preacher, Reverend Phelps, was stooped over, half deaf, and none of what he said made any sense--it was all frightening metaphors about sin and salvation. But when Reverend Ayers with his sparkling blue eyes spoke, it felt as if he said each word right to me.<br><br>&#x201c;I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.&#x201d;<br><br>For the first time, I understood the word of God, because Reverend Ayers spoke it. His voice, all the girls said, could soothe the Devil himself.<br><br>A red-winged blackbird cried out conk-a-reee from a nearby hazel bush. He puffed up his red shoulders and sang over and over, as loud as he could, his call almost hypnotic; even Reverend Ayers paused to look.<br><br>Mrs. Jameson dropped to her knees, keening. Mr. Jameson tried to pull her up, but did not have the strength.<br><br>I stood right beside Papa, clutching his hand, as dirt was shoveled down on the coffin of poor Hester Jameson. Hester had a crooked front tooth, but a beautifully delicate face. She had been the best in our class at arithmetic. Once, for my birthday, she gave me a note with a flower pressed inside. A violet it was, dried out and perfectly preserved. May your day be as special as you are, she&#x2019;d written in perfect cursive. I tucked it into my Bible, where it stayed for years, until it either disintegrated or fell out, I cannot recall.<br><br>Now, two weeks after her very own funeral, Hester&#x2019;s sleeper caught sight of me there in the woods, crouching behind the rock. I shall never forget the look in her eyes--the frightened half-recognition of someone waking from a horrible dream.<br><br>I had heard about sleepers; there was even a game we played in the schoolyard in which one child would be laid out dead in a circle of violets and forget-me-nots. Then someone would lean down and whisper magic words in the dead girl&#x2019;s ear, and she would rise and chase all the other children. The first one she caught would be the next to die.<br><br>I think I may have even played this game once with Hester Jameson.<br><br>I had heard whispers, rumors of sleepers called back from the land of the dead by grieving husbands and wives, but was certain they only existed in the stories old women liked to tell each other while they folded laundry or stitched stockings--something to pass the time, and to make any eavesdropping children hurry home before dark.<br><br>I had been sure, up until then, that God in his infinite wisdom would not have allowed such an abomination.<br><br>Hester and I were not ten feet apart. Her blue dress was filthy and torn, her corn-silk hair in tangles. She gave off the musty smell of damp earth, but there was something else behind it, an acrid, greasy, burnt odor, similar to what you smell when you blow out a tallow candle.<br><br>Our eyes met, and I yearned to speak, to say her name, but could only manage a strangled-sounding Hss.<br><br>Hester ran off into the woods like a startled rabbit. I stayed frozen, clinging pathetically to my rock like a bit of lichen.<br><br>From down the path leading to the Devil&#x2019;s Hand came another figure, running, calling Hester&#x2019;s name.<br><br>It was her mother, Cora Jameson.<br><br>She stopped when she saw me, face flushed and frantic. She was breathing hard and had scratches on her face and arms, pieces of dry leaves and twigs tangled in her hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell no one,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; I asked, stepping out from behind the rock.<br><br>She looked right at me--through me, almost, as if I were a pane of dirty window glass. &#x201c;Someday, Sara,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;maybe you&#x2019;ll love someone enough to understand.&#x201d;<br><br>Then she ran off into the woods, following her daughter.<br><br>I told Auntie about it later.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it really possible?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;To bring someone back like that?&#x201d;<br><br>We were down by the river, picking fiddleheads, filling Auntie&#x2019;s basket with the curled fern tops, as we did each spring. Then we&#x2019;d bring them home and make a creamy soup stuffed full of wild greens and herbs that Auntie had gathered along the way. We were also there to check the traps--Auntie had caught a beaver just two days before and was hoping for another. Beaver pelts were a rarity and brought a high price. They were once nearly as common as squirrels&#x2019;, Auntie said, but trappers had taken all except a handful.<br><br>Buckshot was with us, nosing the ground, ears attentive to every little sound. I never knew if he was all wolf, or only part. Auntie had found him as a pup, when he&#x2019;d fallen into one of her pit traps after being all shot up by someone. She&#x2019;d carried him home, pulled the buckshot pellets out of him, stitched him up, and nursed him back to health. He&#x2019;d been by her side ever since.<br><br>&#x201c;He was lucky you found him,&#x201d; I said after hearing the story.<br><br>&#x201c;Luck had nothing to do with it,&#x201d; Auntie told me. &#x201c;He and I were meant for one another.&#x201d;<br><br>I never saw such devotion in a dog--or any animal, for that matter. His wounds had healed, but the buckshot left him blind in his right eye, which was milky white. His ghost eye, Auntie called it.<br><br>&#x201c;He came so close to death, he&#x2019;s got one eye back there still,&#x201d; she explained. I loved Buckshot, but I hated that milky-white moon that seemed to see everything and nothing all at once.<br><br>Auntie was not related to me by blood, but she cared for me, raised me after my own mother died giving birth to me. I had no memory of my mother--the only proofs of her existence were my parents&#x2019; wedding photograph, the quilt she&#x2019;d sewn that I slept under every night, and the stories my older brother and sister told.<br><br>My brother claimed I had my mother&#x2019;s laugh. My sister said that my mother had been the best dancer in the county, that she was the envy of all the other girls.<br><br>Auntie&#x2019;s people came from up north, in Quebec. Her father had been a trapper; her mother, an Indian woman. Auntie carried a hunting knife, and wore a long deerskin coat decorated with bright beads and porcupine quills. She spoke French, and sang songs in a language I never did recognize. She wore a ring carved from yellowed bone on her right pointer finger.<br><br>&#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d; I asked once, touching the strange letters and symbols on its surface.<br><br>&#x201c;That life is a circle,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>People in town were frightened of Auntie, but their fear did not keep them away from her door. They followed the well-worn path to her cabin in the woods out behind the Devil&#x2019;s Hand, carrying coins, honey, whiskey--whatever they had to trade for her remedies. Auntie had drops for colic, tea for fever, even a little blue bottle that she swore contained a potion so powerful that with one drop the object of your heart&#x2019;s desire would be yours. I knew better than to doubt her.<br><br>There were other things I knew about Auntie, too. I&#x2019;d seen her sneak out of Papa&#x2019;s bedroom in the early morning, heard the sounds that came from behind his locked door when she visited him there.<br><br>I also knew better than to cross her. She had a fiery temper and little patience with people who did not see things her way. If people refused to pay her for her services, she&#x2019;d call on them, sprinkle their homes with black powder pulled from one of her leather pouches, and speak a strange incantation. Terrible things would befall those families from then on: sicknesses, fires, crop losses, even death.<br><br>I tossed a handful of dark-green fiddleheads into the basket.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, Auntie, please,&#x201d; I begged, &#x201c;can the dead come back?&#x201d;<br><br>Auntie looked at me a long time, head cocked to the side, her small, dark eyes fixed on mine.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she told me at last. &#x201c;There is a way. Few know of it, but those who do, pass it down to their children. Because you are the closest I will ever come to a child of my own, the secret will go to you. I will write it all down, everything I know about sleepers. I will fold up the papers, put them in an envelope, and seal it with wax. You will hide it away, and one day, when you are ready, you will open it up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How will I know I am ready?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>She smiled, showing her small teeth, pointed like a fox&#x2019;s and stained brown from tobacco. &#x201c;You will know.&#x201d;<br><br>I am writing these words in secret, hidden under covers. Martin and Lucius believe I am sleeping. I hear them downstairs, drinking coffee and discussing my prognosis. (Not good, I&#x2019;m afraid.)<br><br>I have been going back in my mind, thinking over how all of this began, piecing things together the way one might sew a quilt. But, oh, what a hideous and twisted quilt mine would be!<br><br>&#x201c;Gertie,&#x201d; I hear Martin say above the clink of a spoon stirring coffee in his favorite tin mug. I imagine the furrow of his brow, the deep worry lines there; how sad his face must be after he spoke her name.<br><br>I hold my breath and listen hard.<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes a tragedy breaks a person,&#x201d; Lucius says. &#x201c;Sometimes they will never be whole again.&#x201d;<br><br>If I close my eyes even now, I can still see my Gertie&#x2019;s face, feel her sugary breath on my cheek. I can so vividly recall our last morning together, hear her saying, &#x201c;If snow melts down to water, does it still remember being snow?&#x201d;<br>Martin<br><br>January 12, 1908<br><br>&#x201c;Wake up, Martin.&#x201d; A soft whisper, a flutter against his cheek. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;<br><br>Martin opened his eyes, leaving the dream of a woman with long dark hair. She&#x2019;d been telling him something. Something important, something he was not supposed to forget.<br><br>He turned over in bed. He was alone, Sara&#x2019;s side of the bed cold. He sat up, listening carefully. Voices, soft giggles across the hall, from behind Gertie&#x2019;s bedroom door.<br><br>Had Sara spent the whole night in with Gertie again? Surely it couldn&#x2019;t be good for the girl, to smother her like that. Sometimes he worried that Sara&#x2019;s attachment to Gertie simply wasn&#x2019;t . . . healthy. Just last week, Sara had kept Gertie home from school for three straight days, and for those three days Sara doted on her--plaiting her hair, making her a new dress, baking her cookies, playing hide-and-seek. Sara&#x2019;s niece, Amelia, offered to take Gertie for the weekend, and Sara had made excuses--she gets homesick so easily, she&#x2019;s so frail--but Martin understood that it was Sara who could not bear to be without Gertie. Sara never seemed whole unless Gertie was by her side.<br><br>He pushed the worried thoughts away. Better to focus on the problems he understood and could do something about.<br><br>The house was cold, the fire out.<br><br>He peeled back the covers, threw his legs over the side of the bed, and pulled on his pants. His bad foot hung there like a hoof till he shoved it into the special boot fashioned for him by the cobbler in Montpelier. The soles were worn through, and he&#x2019;d stuffed the bottoms of both boots with dry grass and cattail fluff, all layered over scraps of leather, in a futile attempt to keep the dampness out. There was no money for new custom-made boots now.<br><br>Blight had ruined most of last fall&#x2019;s potato crop, and they relied on the money they got from selling the potatoes to the starch factory to get through the winter. It was only January, and the root cellar was nearly bare: a few spongy potatoes and carrots, some Hubbard squash, half a dozen jars of string beans and tomatoes Sara had put up last summer, a little salt pork from the hog they&#x2019;d butchered in November (they&#x2019;d traded most of the meat for dry goods at the general store). Martin would have to get a deer soon if they were going to have enough to eat. Sara had a talent for stretching what little food they had, for making milk gravy and biscuits with a bit of salt pork into a meal, but she couldn&#x2019;t create something from nothing.</p><h2>The Heir (Windham Series, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>A<em> New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today</em> Bestseller!</strong></p><p>"a refreshing and captivating love story."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, STARRED Review</p><p><strong>Gayle Windham, earl of Westhaven, is the first legitimate son and heir to the duke of Moreland.

Grace is branching out into short stories and Scotland-set Victorian romance with Sourcebooks. She is a practicing family law attorney and lives in rural Maryland.</p><p><i>From One</i></p> <p>Gayle Windham, Earl of Westhaven, was enjoying a leisurely measure of those things that pleased him most: solitude, peace, and quiet. </p> <p>The best plans were the simplest, he reflected as he poured himself a single finger of brandy, and his brother's suggestion that Westhaven hide in plain sight had proven brilliant. The unmarried heir to a dukedom had a nigh impossible task if he wanted to elude the predatory mamas and determined debutantes of polite society. He was in demand everywhere, and for form's sake, he had to be seen everywhere.</p> <p><i>But not this summer</i>. He smiled with relish. This summer, this stinking, infernally hot summer, he was going to remain right where he was, in the blessedly empty confines of London itself. Not for him the endless round of house parties and boating parties and social gatherings in the country.</p> <p>His father had too free a hand in those environs, and Westhaven knew better than to give the duke any unnecessary advantage. </p> <p>The Duke of Moreland was a devious, determined, unscrupulous old rogue. His goal in life was to see to it his heir married and produced sons, and Westhaven had made it a matter of pride to outwit the old man. There had already been one forced engagement, which the lady's family had thwarted at the last minute. One was more than enough. Westhaven was a dutiful son, conscientious in his responsibilities, a brother who could be relied upon, an heir more than willing to tend to the properties and investments as his father's power of attorney. He would not, however, be forced to marry some simpering little puppet to breed sons on her like a rutting hound.</p> <p>And already, the pleasure of days and nights uncluttered by meaningless entertainments was bringing a certain cheer to Westhaven's normally reserved demeanor. He found himself noticing things, like the way his townhouse bore the fragrance of roses and honeysuckle, or how an empty grate was graced with a bouquet of flowers just for the pleasure of his eye. His solitary meals tasted more appealing; he slept better on his lavender-scented sheets. He heard his neighbor playing the piano late at night, and he caught the sound of laughter drifting up from his kitchen early in the morning.</p> <p><i>I would have made an exemplary monk</i>, he thought as he regarded the bowl of roses on the cold andirons. But then, monks had little solitude, and no recreational access to the fairer sex.</p> <p>A modest exponent thereof silently entered the library, bobbed her little curtsy, and went about refilling the water in the several vases of flowers gracing the room. He watched her as she moved around without a sound, and wondered when she'd joined his household. She was a pretty little thing, with graceful ways and a sense of competence about her.</p> <p>The chambermaid paused to water the flowers in the hearth, reaching over the fireplace screen to carefully top up the wide bowl of roses sitting on the empty grate. <i>Who would think to put flowers in a cold fireplace? </i>Westhaven wondered idly, but then he realized the chambermaid was taking rather too long to complete her task.</p> <p>"Is something amiss?" he asked, not meaning to sound irritated but concluding he must have, for the girl flinched and cowered. She didn't, however, straighten up, make another curtsy, and leave him to his brandy.</p> <p>"Is something amiss?" He spoke more slowly, knowing menials were not always of great understanding. The girl whimpered, an odd sound, not speech but an indication of distress. And she remained right where she was, bent over the hearth screen, her pitcher of water in her hand.</p> <p>Westhaven set down his brandy and rose from his wingchair, the better to investigate the problem. The girl was making that odd sound continuously, which pleased him not at all. It wasn't as if he'd <i>ever </i>trifled with the help, for God's sake.</p> <p>When he came near the hearth, the chambermaid positively cringed away from him, another irritant, but her movement allowed Westhaven to see the difficulty: The buttons on the front of her bodice were caught in the mesh of the hearth screen. She wasn't tall enough to set down her pitcher, leaving her only one hand with which to free herself. That hand, however, she needed for balance.</p> <p>"Hush," Westhaven said more gently. He did have five sisters, after all, and a mother; he understood females were prone to dramatics. "I'll have you free in no time, if you'll just hold still and turn loose of this pitcher."</p> <p>He had to pry the girl's fingers from the handle of the pitcher, so overset was she, but still she said nothing, just warbled her distress like a trapped animal. "No need to take on so," he soothed as he reached around her so he could slide his fingers along the screen. "We'll have you free in a moment, and next time you'll know to move the screen before you try to water the flowers." It took an infernally long time, but he had one button forced back through the screen and was working on the other when the girl's whimpering escalated to a moan.</p> <p>"Hush," he murmured again. "I won't hurt you, and I almost have your buttons free. Just hold still-" The first blow landed across his shoulders, a searing flash of pain that left his fine linen shirt and his skin torn. The second followed rapidly, as he tightened his arms protectively around the maid, and at the third, which landed smartly on the back of his head, everything went black.</p></p><h2>Reamde</h2><p>Above all, Reamde is an enthralling human story&#x2014;an entertaining and epic page-turner from the extraordinary Neal Stephenson.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, September 2011</strong>: Neal Stephenson is quite rightly known as a writer of ideas, but don't put it past him to pen a straightforward thriller. True, the plot of said thriller hinges on a massively multiplayer online game that's a step beyond what's actually available on the Internet circa 2011, but that's as far as the sci-fi goes. Enter "REAMDE," an online virus that brings together a super-rich CEO, a Chinese hacker, a rogue Russian mafioso, an assimilated East African beauty, an itinerant Hungarian software programmer, two insanely prolific fantasy writers, and guns, guns, guns. (The book features so much firepower that Stephenson enlisted what he calls a "ballistics copy editor.") It takes a veritable master of pacing to make a thousand pages feel like barely a third of that, but Stephenson is that master; his breakneck narrative starts fast and never, ever lets up. As such, <em>Reamde</em> is as likely to turn off fans of his more cerebral fiction as it is to gain him scads of new devotees. Regardless, it marks an inimitable highlight of this year's thriller roster. --<em>Jason Kirk</em><p>From the extraordinary Neal Stephenson comes an epic adventure that spans entire worlds, both real and virtual.</p><p>The black sheep of an Iowa farming clan, former draft dodger and successful marijuana smuggler Richard Forthrast amassed a small fortune over the years&#x2014;and then increased it a thousandfold when he created T'Rain.

Lynn explores the many tragic facets that both nurtured Hemingway&#39;s work and eroded his life.Undaunted by the large body of biographical and critical work that has preceded his own, Lynn succeeds in casting the familiar life of Ernest Hemingway in a new and interesting light. He focuses on key events and relationships that affected the novels and short stories that ultimately changed our literature: Hemingway's traumatic wounding in World War I; his wives and lovers; and, most importantly, the parents who shaped his Oak Park years. Cursed with the same depressive streak, Hemingway was haunted by his father's suicide. Much of his own strength and talent was drawn from his mother, but her overpowering influence left other marks as well. She dressed him as a twin to his older sister when he was a toddler, an experience that undoubtedly contributed to the subsequent counter-posture of excessive masculinity central to Hemingway's public image. Nevertheless, Lynn finds evidence aplenty that this childhood feminization also accounted for a lifelong fascination with androgyny and sexual transposition vis-a-vis women, imparting another level of meaning to Hemingway's oft-repeated declaration that in his writing he wanted "to make people feel more than they understood." Taking as his premise Hemingway's glib assertion that the only analyst he relied upon was his "portable Corona Number 3," Lynn (Literary and Historical Writing About America, etc.t tracks the exploration of a disordered inner world as Hemingway sought to find some sort of resolution to the agony of his personal conflicts through "his cunningly wrought fiction." The man who emerges from Lynn's biography is a vastly more complex and compelling figure than the white-bearded, pontificating "Papa" of myth. Photos.

The karate training process comprises four areas: basics, kata (forms; prearranged movements and techniques), kumite, and competition. Kumite-"the art of grappling with opponents," as it might be called-is the application of kata, and is the key to success in karate tournaments.<br><br><em>Karate Fighting Techniques</em> teaches all the various kumite techniques, and presents a systematic approach to applied kumite that is designed to provide essnetial information for match-style kumite and tournament kumite. The author also writes with great affection of his experiences with Master Gichin Funakoshi, and offers some insight into the true spirit and teachings of Shotokan karate.<br><br>With 700 photos of the author, his students, and some rare photos of the late Gichin Funakoshi and his famous disciple Masatoshi Nakayama (author of the popular <em>Best Karate</em> series), <em>Karate Fighting Techniques</em> is the first book of its kind to provide such a comprehensive guide to kumite and its role in Shotokan karate. It will be an indispensable resource for all karate practitioners.</p><p><br>HIROKAZU KANAZAWA, president of Shotokan Karate-do International Federation, carries on the spirit and techniques of his teacher, Gichin Funakoshi. Born in 1931 in Iwate prefecture, Japan, Mr. Kanazawa began practicing karate as a student at Takushoku University and, after graduation, became an instructor for the Japan Karate Association. He has earned many titles in competition, winning first place in kumite at the first Japan Karate Championship in 1957, and taking top honors in both kumite and kata the following year at the second Japan Karate Championship. His long career as a chief instructor dates back to 1960, when he was invited to teach in Hawaii. He has also taught elsewhere in the United States and throughout Europe. In 1979, he founded Shotokan Karate-do International Federation, which now has branches in over 90 countries. Mr. Kanazawa is the author of <em>Karate-My Life</em> and several books in Japanese on karate.<br><br>RICHARD BERGER was born in Rochester, New York, in 1963 and began training in Shotokan karate in 1982 while attending university in Southern California.

By the eighteenth century, only Great Britain and France remained as rivals for the heart of the continent. Three times, beginning in 1690, warfare arose between New France and New England. Settlements were destroyed, and armies clashed, yet nothing was settled. Each country regarded the Ohio Valley as its own. A small skirmish in 1754 touched off a war that spread to Europe, then to Africa, Asia, and even to islands in the Atlantic and Pacific. The fate of North America hung in the balance. This conflict, the Great War for the Empire, may well be called the first of the world wars. Here, award-winning historian Francis Russell brings to life the vast panorama that formed the background for this struggle in which the English redcoats fought side by side with American colonists against French soldiers and their Indian allies.</p><p></p><h2>Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels</h2><p>Carl Macek, the man who brought the ROBOTECH phenomenon to the United States, tells the story of THE SENTINELS, the television series that was to take over where ROBOTECH left off.

One was an orphaned puppy, abandoned by his owners as they fled Nazi forces. The other was a different kind of lost soul--a Czech airman bound for the Royal Air Force and the country that he would come to call home. <br>Airman Robert Bozdech stumbled across the tiny German shepherd--whom he named Ant--after being shot down on a daring mission over enemy lines. Unable to desert his charge, Robert hid Ant inside his jacket as he escaped. In the months that followed the pair would save each other's lives countless times as they flew together with Bomber Command. And though Ant was eventually grounded due to injury, he refused to abandon his duty, waiting patiently beside the runway for his master's return from every sortie, and refusing food and sleep until they were reunited. By the end of the war Robert and Ant had become British war heroes, and Ant was justly awarded the Dickin Medal, the "Animal VC." <br>With beautiful vintage black-and-white photos of Robert and Ant, "The Dog Who Could Fly" is a deeply moving story of loyalty in the face of adversity and the unshakable bond between a man and his best friend.</p><p>Damien Lewis has spent the last twenty years reporting from war, disaster and conflict zones across the African continent, with a particular focus and expertise in Sudan.

The French pilot and his Czech gunner survived the devastating crash landing, and in the epic escape bid that followed one of the most remarkable and enduring man&#x2013;animal partnerships of the Second World War was forged.<br> <br>I first heard about the relationship between the Royal Air Force&#x2019;s flying dog of war and Czech airman Robert Bozdech in a passing comment made by British soldier and bestselling author Captain David Blakeley (Pathfinder and Maverick One). Blakeley&#x2014;a fellow dog lover&#x2014;had read two of my previous books about extraordinary man&#x2013;dog partnerships forged on the front line of war&#x2014;Sergeant Rex and It&#x2019;s All About Treo, both of which were coauthored with the modern-day bomb-detection dog handlers whose stories they portrayed.<br> <br>Blakeley&#x2019;s comment was: &#x201c;If you want to read a truly amazing story of a man and dog at war, look up Ant and Robert Bozdech&#x2019;s story, from the Second World War. It&#x2019;ll blow you away.&#x201d;<br> <br>My curiosity piqued, I went on to read as widely as I could about their story (see the references at the end of this book). But one thing struck me most powerfully: while the tale of the heroic man-and-dog duo who fought with Bomber Command during the Second World War had seemingly been told, it remained something of a riddle wrapped up inside a mystery in an enigma. Their story was supposedly related in the 1965 book One Man and His Dog, but Robert Bozdech was not the author of that book. It was written by the late author and journalist Anthony Richardson, and in its pages Robert Bozdech was strangely referred to as Jan Bozdech. Altogether, my reading of it seemed to raise as many questions as it answered.<br> <br>The deeper I dug the more curious it all became. There was originally talk of a film to be made by 20th Century-Fox based upon the heroic duo&#x2019;s life story, but for reasons unexplained it had never gone into production. I wondered why. This of any story cried out to be turned into a dramatic and compelling movie. There was talk of Robert Bozdech&#x2019;s dissatisfaction with the book as it was published, but it remained unclear as to what exactly had troubled him. Did that perhaps explain why the book hadn&#x2019;t used his real name and why the film had never been made?<br> <br>But most intriguing of all to an author such as myself, there was talk of an original manuscript written by Robert Bozdech, one telling the story of his airborne adventures with Ant, but one that had never seen the light of day. I wondered if such a manuscript had really ever existed, and if so what story it might reveal. Surely, it would tell the full and unexpurgated account of Robert and Ant&#x2019;s extraordinary adventures as written from the heart by the man who had lived it? If such a manuscript had been written it would have been penned sometime in the early sixties&#x2014;over fifty years ago&#x2014;which raised the question of whether a copy still existed today.<br> <br>There was only one way to answer these many questions, and that was to make contact with the surviving members of the Bozdech family. After the war, Robert Bozdech had made Britain his permanent home&#x2014;after a short sojourn in his native Czechoslovakia&#x2014;settling with his veteran war dog, taking British nationality, and raising a family. I found out that Robert&#x2019;s son, Robert Bozdech Jr., lived in a picturesque part of the west of England in what turned out to be the family home. I corresponded with Robert, we spoke on the phone, and in due course I traveled to south Devon to meet him, along with his two sisters, Pip and Nina. The rambling house seemed to have been shaped and formed by those who had lived there for so long, Mrs. Maureen Bozdech only recently having passed away. I was given a gracious welcome, and over tea and cake the questions to which I had for so long sought answers began to resolve themselves.<br> <br>Robert Bozdech had helped with the writing of Richardson&#x2019;s One Man and His Dog, but the two men had not gotten on at all well. In fact, it seemed they had had some blazing arguments along the way. 20th Century&#x2013;Fox had indeed resolved to make a film based upon that book, but for some reason it had fallen by the wayside. Most surprisingly of all, Robert Bozdech had not been able to reveal his true name&#x2014;V�clav Bozdech&#x2014;or publish his own story in his own words, because of fears of reprisals against his family in his native Czechoslovakia. Shortly after the Communists took control in Czechoslovakia, Robert found himself a target of pogroms, intimidation, and threats, as did so many Czech airmen, sailors, and soldiers who had fought in the Allied cause. In a form of collateral damage resulting from the Cold War, any Czech with military links to &#x201c;the West&#x201d; was seen as being a potential enemy of Czechoslovakia, a state that then formed a part of the Soviet bloc. Hence it was that Robert&#x2019;s story had been effectively silenced by threats of violence, imprisonment, and worse emanating from the country of his birth.<br> <br>It was then that I put the million-dollar question to the late Robert Bozdech&#x2019;s family: had their father actually written his own version of his and Ant&#x2019;s story in a book or a diary, one that had never seen the light of day?<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, you mean Dad&#x2019;s original manuscript?&#x201d; Robert Jr. replied. &#x201c;Yes, of course. I&#x2019;ll just fetch a copy.&#x201d;<br> <br>He wandered off into a back room, returning a few minutes later with an old-fashioned blue ring binder clutched in one hand. He rubbed it down, dust seeming to dance and sparkle in the sunbeams that streamed through the summer window.<br> <br>He slid it across the table to me. &#x201c;Here it is. Dad called it Antis VC.&#x201d; Robert paused, then laughed a little self-consciously. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s far better than anything else that&#x2019;s ever been written.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I flipped open the file, and read the first line of a neatly typed manuscript: &#x201c;The author, who served with distinction in the RAF during the last war, has lost touch with most of his old comrades. Perhaps this book may reach and reunite them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced up from the page. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you mind if I borrow this for a proper read?&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert looked to his sisters, then back at me. I detected a twinkle in his kind and trusting eyes. &#x201c;No, not at all. We&#x2019;ve always wanted Dad&#x2019;s story to see the light of day. We&#x2019;d be delighted if an author such as yourself might help tell it for us, and properly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, how do you come to have a manuscript such as this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet it&#x2019;s never been published?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you see, Dad wrote it out first by hand,&#x201d; Pip, Robert&#x2019;s older sister, explained. &#x201c;For years we only had that handwritten version. Then, back in the time of typewriters&#x2014;prior to computers&#x2014;I offered to type it out. God knows what possessed me to do so, for it took forever,&#x201d; she joked. &#x201c;Anyhow, that&#x2019;s the version you&#x2019;re now holding. Dad included a lot of penciled notes in the margins, along with his original words, so I incorporated those as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shook my head in amazement. &#x201c;Well, all I can say is I&#x2019;m glad you did and saved the story for posterity.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad could never have had it published when the Communists were still in power,&#x201d; Nina, Robert&#x2019;s younger sister, added. &#x201c;He had a wife and child that he was forced to leave in Czechoslovakia, plus all the rest of his family. The regime took horrible reprisals against those who&#x2019;d fought with the Allies. He knew it would have to be published after his death or after the Communist regime had fallen, whichever came the sooner. Well, both things have come to pass now, of course, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;Dad would want you to read it, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thanked the three of them, and as I left their home I felt as if I had a hidden gem clutched under my arm. I wondered if Robert Bozdech had written his manuscript in the very hope that one day it might be rediscovered. I could only imagine that was the case, for what other reason could he have had for doing so? On the drive home I was barely able to resist the temptation to pull into a rest stop so I could dive in. In the peace and quiet of my study I was finally able to devour the story as told by Robert Bozdech, in his own words.<br> <br>His manuscript told a tale of death-defying feats by brave Czech airmen driven to avenge their countrymen, and who refused to be cowed by the Nazi invaders of their country. It was a tale of bitter and bloody action above war-torn France, of a handful of airmen who battled overwhelming odds and far superior German warplanes as the defense of Europe crumbled under the Nazi blitzkrieg. It was a tale of an epic escape from occupied France, and of the remarkable bluff and chutzpah that got Robert Bozdech and his dog, Ant, safely into the UK, along with a handful of fellow Czech airmen. It became a story then of the most remarkable and renowned man-dog duo of the war&#x2014;Ant becoming famed as the dog who flew countless death-defying sorties with the RAF over Europe.<br> <br>I met several further times with Robert, Pip, and Nina, and they could not have been more gracious or generous in their support. In an effort to better reveal their father and his dog&#x2019;s incredible story, they dug out and dusted down suitcases full of their late father&#x2019;s personal effects&#x2014;ones that had lain half forgotten in the attic of Pip&#x2019;s Devon farmhouse. They contained dog-eared diary entries and flight logs, faded newspaper cuttings and scores of photographs, all from the time that their father and his dog flew with the RAF in the war-torn skies of Europe. There were postcards home and letters to family. There were scores of articles and short booklets written by Robert Bozdech immediately after the war, in his native Czech. There were even some ancient &#x201c;four-inch&#x201d; reel-to-reel tape recordings, ones that contained Robert&#x2019;s voice telling his and Ant&#x2019;s story in his own words&#x2014;seemingly something to do with the widespread media coverage that he and his dog had enjoyed immediately after the war.<br> <br>Remarkable.<br> <br>What emerged from this plethora of material was above all else a story of the unshakable and unbreakable love between one man and his dog, a love that enabled the duo to survive numerous brushes with death in a way that seemed to defy comprehension. Ant (or Antis as he was subsequently renamed) was the only dog to fly and fight with the RAF&#x2019;s Bomber Command. He was repeatedly wounded on the ground and in the air, and shot down under fire. He had had his own doggie oxygen mask crafted for him by the Bomber Command technicians, and his ever more extreme brushes with death meant that he must have had many more than a cat&#x2019;s nine lives.<br> <br>In short, the story as revealed in Robert Bozdech&#x2019;s original manuscript and the associated materials was a gripping account of the most celebrated partnership between man and dog of the Second World War, a tale that remains unparalleled to this day.<br> <br>This, then, is their story, told as much as possible in Robert&#x2019;s own words.<br> <br>Damien Lewis, Cork, Ireland, 2013</p><h2>Insidious (The Twixt)</h2><p>True evil is rarely obvious.

She smiled at her boyfriend, who stood in the hall looking human.<br><br>"Ink!" she said, giving him a kiss on the cheek. He smelled like spring rain. "Just act normal," she whispered by his ear.<br><br>Ink blinked in confusion. His glamour made his all-black eyes look brown.<br><br>"I am not normal," he said.<br><br>Joy hooked his arm and squeezed. "Aaaaaand that's what I love about you." She steered him into the condo. "Ink's here!"<br><br>"We can see that," Stef said, coming up behind her. "We have eyes. Two of them, in fact. Both in working condition." He gave a toothy grin. "Imagine that."<br><br>Joy frowned. Her brother didn't mention that Ink had stabbed her in the eye six months ago when he'd discovered that she had the Sight&#x2014;the ability to see the Folk like him in the Twixt&#x2014;but he didn't have to; it hung in the air like an unspoken threat. The kitchen light flashed off of her brother's glyph-scribbled glasses.<br><br>"Stef&#x2014;" Joy warned.<br><br>He pointed to himself. "Older brother," he said. "It's part of the job. With great power comes great scrutiny."<br><br>"Stef." Their father's voice came from across the kitchen. "Are you harassing our guest?"<br><br>Joy said, "Yes!" just as Stef said "No!"<br><br>Mr. Malone shook his head. His girlfriend, Shelley, chuckled while untying her apron. "Let's all sit down," she said soothingly. "Dinner's ready."<br><br>Stef stepped aside. Joy marched Ink in.<br><br><em>We can do this,</em> she thought. <em>No problem. It's not war, it's not life-and-death&#x2014;it's just dinner with my family. And my boyfriend. My inhuman, immortal, usually invisible boyfriend.</em> She patted Ink's arm. <em>Okay, remember: one conniption fit at a time.</em><br><br>"Have a seat." Joy's father waved at the table. "Glad you could make it, Mark." Mr. Malone refused to call Ink by his nickname, which was funny since "Mark Carver" was his human alias&#x2014;everyone in the Twixt called him "Indelible Ink." His True Name was written as an unpronounceable symbol, a <em>signatura.</em> Names were powerful things in the Twixt, and the Folk had learned to take precautions against human entrapment.<br><br>"I'm glad to be here," Ink said, careful to use contractions. Joy had coached him that he sounded more human that way. Joy guided Ink to the chair next to hers. It was the one she'd been sitting in when he'd first traced her ear, exploring the tiniest details of what it meant to be human...and accidentally learning what it felt like to fall in love.<br><br>She saw him remember. Two dimples appeared, and Joy felt her cheeks warm as she smiled.<br><br>Stef sat down and began heaping chicken and green beans onto his plate. Joy grabbed the platter out of his hands.<br><br>"Guests first," Joy said through clenched teeth.<br><br>"That's right, Stef," Mr. Malone said as he offered Ink a large bowl of roasted red potatoes. "You know the rules."<br><br>Picking up the salad, Stef scooped out big chunks of feta and black olives. "Whatever happened to 'you snooze, you lose'?"<br><br>"Some rules are meant to be broken," Mr. Malone said. "Like free Wi-Fi privileges while you're home if you don't start acting more civil. Got it?"<br><br>Stef stared at his plate and nodded. "Got it."<br><br>Mr. Malone sighed. "Sorry, Mark," her dad said, reaching for the salad. "The unofficial family motto is what got this family through puberty. These two grew up eating everything in sight."<br><br>Shelley leaned forward with a stage whisper. "My advice? Watch your fingers."<br><br>Ink clutched the bowl closer, eyeing Joy and Stef warily.<br><br>Joy swallowed. "Ha-ha," she said. "Just a joke. Very funny." Given the variety of monsters who lived in the Twixt, Joy could well imagine that some of them ate fingers. She served a portion of chicken to Ink and kept the platter moving. Ink slowly relaxed, loosening his grip on the potatoes. She nudged his knee and rolled her eyes toward her dad.<br><br>"Joy has been talking about the big trip this weekend," Ink said, reciting his opening line like a pro. "How long will you be gone?"<br><br>Mr. Malone grinned. "Three days," he said and clapped a hand on Stef's shoulder. "One last camping weekend before this one goes back to college."<br><br>Stef didn't respond as he chewed, but Joy suspected it was less about his bottomless appetite and more about avoiding talking directly to Ink.<br><br>"Will you be visiting Stef on campus?" Shelley asked Joy.<br><br>Joy exchanged a look with her brother. Both frowned. "No. Why?"<br><br>"Oh, well, I didn't know if U Penn was on your list," Shelley said as she stacked three cucumber slices on her fork. "I asked your father, and he said he didn't know your plans."<br><br>"Plans?" Joy said.<br><br>"It's your senior year," Mr. Malone said. "I know we sent off a bunch of college applications, but I haven't heard anything since."<br><br>Joy was speechless. College applications had been the last thing on her mind. After Mom had left, she had quit gymnastics and joined Dad's swan dive into a sea of depression, axing her dreams of becoming an Olympian, which was all she'd ever wanted since age six. She'd become a numb, moping black hole. Shaking it off had been largely thanks to her best friend, Monica, a night dancing at their favorite club and unexpectedly getting stabbed in the eye. A lot had happened since January. She'd forgotten all about college.<br><br>"Um..."<br><br>"I know it's been a tough year," her dad said. "And I didn't want to push, but you really need to start thinking about what you want to do next fall." He saw her squirm in her seat and gave a slight nod, acknowledging Ink. "We can talk about it more during the trip."<br><br>Joy untwisted her fingers from the edge of her shirt. "Yeah. Okay."<br><br>"And what do you do, Mark?" Shelley asked Ink. Joy had told her father that Ink was a kind of exclusive tattoo artist...it had not gone over well.<br><br>"I mark people," Ink said.<br><br>Joy almost snarfed her lemon water. She grabbed her napkin, and Ink looked mischievously pleased as he continued, "I like to say I get paid to draw on people's skin." Joy marveled at the single dimple tucked into his half smile like a smirk. "It's not exactly glamorous," he said. "But I never want for work."<br><br>Joy pressed her napkin to her mouth, trying not to laugh. He'd told the truth! <em>"Not exactly glamorous"&#x2014;but it had more than paid for his glamour!</em> The wizard's spell had been insanely expensive, but it was the only way her friends and family could see Ink without the Sight. He wore the magical projection like a suit, a perfect picture of himself, but with human-looking eyes and a tattoo of Joy's <em>signatura</em> on his left arm.<br><br>"But that's not a long-term thing, right?" Stef said, looking smug. "What do you want to do when you grow up?"<br><br>Joy picked up the serving spoon, debating its heft.<br><br>Shelley paused over the dressing. "I thought only the chicken was getting grilled tonight," she said and winked at Joy. Joy sent her a smile of thanks. At least Shelley had her back.<br><br>"You're just lucky I didn't invite Monica," Dad said. "She would've brought the thumbscrews."<br><br>Ink glanced at Joy. "Thumbscrews?"<br><br>"He's kidding," Joy said, patting Ink's hand. "Seriously. Kidding."<br><br>Ink's eyebrows twitched under his long, black bangs. "'Seriously kidding'?"<br><br>Stef and Dad exchanged glances. Joy's heart beat doubletime and she waved at Ink to forget about it. She'd try to explain later. <em>If they made it through this dinner alive.</em><br><br>"So, Ink, where do you live?" Stef said with a wicked, knowing grin.<br><br>Joy drained her drink and slammed down her cup. "Anyone need more water?"<br><br>"You sit. I'll get it." Her father got up, snagged the empty pitcher and went to the fridge, filling the room with gurgles and the crack of the ice maker.<br><br>Shelley looked at the glares across the table and sighed. "I'll cut some more lemons," she said and joined Mr. Malone where they could talk quietly by the sink.<br><br>"Have some more ice water," Joy whispered to her brother. "Then take the hint and <em>chill out!"</em><br><br>"I'm testing a theory," Stef whispered back, pointing a fork at Ink. "I thought that his kind couldn't lie." <br><br>Ink looked up, surprised. "I cannot lie."<br><br>"Oh, really, <em>Mark Carver?"</em> <br><br>Joy hissed, <em>"Stef!"</em><br><br>"Ah," Ink said, cutting his roll neatly in half. "I see your mistake. That name is not a lie&#x2014;more like a time-honored tradition." His voice skimmed low over the table, crisp and clear. "I did not change my name, I simply named my glamour 'Mark Carver.'"<br><br>He grinned and took a bite. Butter wet his lips.<br><br>Joy beamed in relief, and Stef laughed despite himself. "Clever," he said.<br><br>Mr. Malone thunked the water pitcher on to the table, cutting off their conversation. He and Shelley sat down.<br><br>"Now, where were we?" he asked, setting his napkin on his lap.<br><br>"Grilling," Ink said.<br><br>Stef snorted.<br><br>Joy lunged for the earthenware bowl. "More potatoes?"<br><br>Ink spooned out three roasted potatoes and watched them wobble across his plate. He poked at one with his fork, painting a long trail of rosemary and oil. Catching a piece of herb on a tine, he examined it curiously, turning the fork over and over, watching the bit of leaf glisten under the lights. His face was a mask of pure fascination. Joy put a hand on his leg. Startled, he looked up with a smile.<br><br>"This looks delicious," Ink said.<br><br>"It is," Mr. Malone said. "It's Shelley's recipe. She's a great cook."<br><br>"Oh, stop," Shelley said and patted her red hair into place. "It's an old family recipe. The secret is to crush fresh herbs and garlic and store it in the olive oil overnight."<br><br>Ink put the potato in his mouth, chewed carefully and swallowed.<br><br>"I have never tasted better," he said. Joy grinned. Besides being polite, Ink was telling the truth: he had only recently begun to taste things because he'd only recently begun to eat. It was fun watching him talk circles around the others, hiding the whole truth behind words that were one hundred percent true.<br><br>Joy's phone rang. She glanced at her purse in the hall.<br><br>"Don't you dare," her father said without looking up from his plate. "Whoever it is can wait."<br><br><em>No phones at the dinner table</em> was a new household rule. Dad was trying to reinstate the sacredness of family dinners before everyone split up again. Joy didn't recognize the ring-tone so it wasn't Monica or Kurt or Graus Claude or Luiz. It might be one of the other Cabana Boys, which made her feel nervous and guilty. Ink's sister, Invisible Inq, had a tribe of mortal lovers who supported one another through thick and thin, like an extended family of hot male models that stretched across the globe. Even if Joy technically wasn't Ink's <em>lehman</em> anymore, she was still considered one of them&#x2014;a mortal who loved one of the Folk&#x2014;and a call from one of the boys meant something important. Joy sat on her hands as the call flipped over to voice mail.<br><br>"Thank you," Dad said. "Now can you please pass the&#x2014;"<br><br>Joy's text messaging pinged. And again. And <em>again.</em> Dad sighed. Stef rolled his eyes. Ink looked up, curious. Joy took a shy bite of green beans. Shelley passed Dad the pepper.<br><br>"Where will you be camping?" Ink asked as he sliced a potato in half. Joy was glad that he could handle subject changes as easily as a fork and knife.<br><br>"Lake James," her father answered and took a drink of water. Ink took a drink at the same time, mimicking her father's movements, watching him with the same intensity he used while watching Joy. Ink was still learning the subtleties of how to act human. His efforts made her smile. Stef glared at his green beans as he chewed.<br><br>"It's a great place," Dad said. "We used to do a lot of family camping trips&#x2014;" he swerved to avoid the words <em>before Mom left</em> and continued smoothly "&#x2014;when the kids were little." The subject of Mom didn't hurt like it once had&#x2014;they'd all grown used to the weekly calls and video chats. Time healed things without meaning to, whether you wanted it to or not. "How about you?" he asked Ink. "What does your family do on vacations?"<br><br>Ink put his fork down, and Joy twisted her napkin over her thumb. This was what they'd been rehearsing ever since Dad suggested that Joy invite Ink over for dinner. Her nervousness reminded her of how Monica had felt about her boyfriend, Gordon, meeting her parents, but Ink wasn't a different race, he was a different <em>reality.</em> As a member of the Twixt, Ink, like Joy, could not lie...but the Folk could be rather creative with the truth.<br><br>"I never knew my parents," Ink said and smiled to take the sting out of his words. "But I have a twin sister, and she's all the family I can handle."<br><br>Joy laughed. Stef didn't. Mr. Malone looked apologetic.<br><br>"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't know."<br><br>Ink shrugged and made looping swirls in the ketchup. "It's all right," he said. "She and I are very close. We've traveled a lot, met lots of interesting people, seen many amazing things together&#x2014;over the years, we have created our own family."<br><br>"That's good," her father said, nodding. "Family's important."<br><br>Mr. Malone glanced over at his son and smiled. It was only recently that Stef had come out as gay, and Joy had forgiven their mother for the divorce. The past two years hadn't been easy for anyone, but they'd made it through as a family&#x2014;albeit a different one from the original. A lot had changed, but they still loved each other, and that was something.<br><br>Shelley turned in her chair, sniffing.<br><br>"Did we leave the stove on?" she asked. "I smell something burning." She got up and walked over to the oven.<br><br>Joy could smell it, too&#x2014;a whiff of smoke like a burnt matchstick. She recognized the odor: vellum and ash. <em>Filly.</em> It must have come from the pouch the young Valkyrie used to send Joy messages. Now Joy knew something was wrong. Ink did, too; his body tightened, tense and alert. Joy put down her fork, trying to think up some excuse to grab her purse and go check.<br><br>That was when she saw the face in the window.<br><br>She almost screamed but bit her lips together. It was a tiny face, different from the monstrous Kodama that had scared her that first time. The small, winged creature pressed its bulbous nose against the glass, hair and beard a wild halo of tangles. It waved to get their attention. Joy couldn't move, but she couldn't look away. Ink casually traced the silver chain at his hip to the wallet in his back pocket where he kept his blades. Joy held her breath as Shelley walked right past the creature on her way back to the table. It watched her pass, its wild eyes bulging with curiosity. Stef's face was carefully neutral, his fingers white-knuckled on his knife. Joy wasn't sure what any of them could do with Dad and Shelley present.<br><br>The creature pointed emphatically at them.<br><br>Under the table, Ink pointed to himself and raised his eyebrows like a question.<br><br>The tiny creature shook its head and pointed again, tapping the glass.<br><br>Shelley glanced at the window. "Do you hear pecking?"<br><br>"It's the birds," Mr. Malone said without turning around.

Spanning the whole of his career, these volumes reflect the breadth and depth of his intellectual and political projects while demonstrating their continued vitality and importance.<br><br><i>Volume 2: Identity and Diaspora</i> draws from Hall's later essays, in which he investigated questions of colonialism, empire, and race. It opens with &#x201c;Gramsci's Relevance for the Study of Race and Ethnicity,&#x201d; which frames the volume and finds Hall rethinking received notions of racial essentialism. In addition to essays on multiculturalism and globalization, black popular culture, and Western modernity's racial underpinnings, <i>Volume 2</i> contains three interviews with Hall, in which he reflects on his life to theorize his identity as a colonial and diasporic subject.</p><p>Stuart Hall (1932&#x2013;2014) was one of the most prominent and influential scholars and public intellectuals of his generation. Hall appeared widely on British media, taught at the University of Birmingham and the Open University, was the founding editor of <i>New Left Review</i>, and served as the director of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. He is the author of <i>Cultural Studies 1983: A Theoretical History</i>; <i>Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands</i>; and other books also published by Duke University Press.<br><br> David Morley is Professor of Communications, Goldsmiths, University of London, and coeditor of <i>Stuart Hall: Conversations, Projects, and Legacies</i>.&#34;Hall&#39;s writings make an extremely important contribution not only in our understanding of the past and the cultural, political, sociological, and theoretical formations that Hall analyzed, but as documents that provide us with powerful political and theoretical tools to understand our present and change our future.&#34; -- Hazel Carby</p><h2>RAWHIDER (Texas Legends, Book 3)</h2><p>Print Olive, the meanest gunman to call Texas home, returns from the Civil War and creates a corrupt cattle empire based on terror and bloodshed.</p><p></p><h2>New York City 5 Borough Pocket Atlas</h2><p>The Pocket Atlas is as shown on the Image.

The staunchest of allies, the Hmong sided with the Americans against the North Vietnamese and were foot soldiers in the brutal secret war for Laos. Since the war, abandoned by their American allies, the Hmong have been subjected to a campaign of genocide by the North Vietnamese, including the use of chemical weapons. <i>Tragic Mountains</i> moves from the big picture of international diplomacy and power politics to the small villages and heroic engagements in the Lao jungle. It is a story of courage, brutality, heroism, betrayal, resilience, and hope.</p></p><p>The staunchest of allies, the Hmong were America&#39;s foot soldiers in the brutal secret Lao theater of the Vietnam War, risking all to defend their homelands and to rescue downed American air crews. Abandoned by the United States when it withdrew in 1975, the Hmong have been subjected to a campaign of genocide by communist Laos and Vietnam, including the use of chemical-biological toxin warfare. Thousands of Hmong, now scattered in refugee camps, are being forcibly repatriated to Laos - where they face retribution and terror. From their ancient homelands in China, with a fiercely independent culture dating back to 2000 B.C., the Hmong migrated southward out of China into the mountains of Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. More than 120,000 Hmong now live in the United States, from California to Minnesota to Pennsylvania. But thousands more lead desperate lives in refugee camps in Southeast Asia - knowing that repatriation could mean death. Tragic Mountains tells the story of the Hmong struggle for freedom and survival in Laos from 1942 to the present. During those years, most Hmong sided with the French against the Japanese and Ho Chi Minh&#39;s Viet Minh and then with the Americans against the North Vietnamese. These allegiances have led the current Lao government to declare the Hmong as enemies, vowing to &#34;&#34;wipe them out.&#34;&#34; This is a story of courage, tenacity, brutality, secrecy, incredible heroism by Hmong and Americans alike, international cynicism, betrayal, genocide, resilience, and (still) hope. Jane Hamilton-Merritt has written it to open the world&#39;s eyes to the proud history and current tragedy of the Hmong - with the desire that this book &#34;&#34;might yet change the destiny of those repatriated.&#34;&#34;<p>Jane Hamilton-Merritt was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1969 for her coverage of the Vietnam War, and in 1998 for the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of her long-standing efforts on behalf of the Hmong. <i>Tragic Mountains</i> is her account of the historic struggle of the Hmong and of their betrayal by the United States.</p></p><h2>Dying of the Trees: The Pandemic in America&#39;s Forests</h2><p>An environmentalist examines loss of trees in every part of the country from New England to California; human-created causes including acid rain, ozone, ultraviolet rays, and clear-cutting; and responses or lack of responses from scientists, government, and citizens. Tour.</p><p>In a thoroughly researched book, Little (Hope for the Land) documents the depressing state of U.S. forests. Individual trees are dying at unprecedented rates, numerous woody species are at risk of extinction and the country's forests are disappearing as intact ecosystems. The devastation stretches across the land and is eerily similar to losses observed in Europe. Although the immediate cause of death varies, Little and the numerous ecologists and foresters whom he interviewed argue convincingly that the best explanation is ultimately the environmental havoc humans have wrought. Acid rain, heavy metal contamination, smog, increased ultraviolet rays streaming through the growing hole in the ozone layer and atrocious management of forests?from clear-cutting to fire suppression?have so weakened individual trees, as well as ecosystems, that once-routine pests may now be responsible for destruction on an unprecedented scale. This book should significantly alter the way we think about our relationship to the natural world. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Caught as we are in a spell of denial and backlash, we're told that environmental concerns have been greatly exaggerated and we no longer need all those pesky laws and regulations. Not so fast says environmental journalist Little, everything is not okay--trees are dying all over the U.S. Little presents the terrible facts about such calamities as the extinction of the eastern dogwood, the toll acid rain has taken on trees from Vermont to North Carolina, and the human-caused plague killing California's ponderosa pine. He also explains how logging and fire prevention alter the composition of forests and lead to such fatal imbalances as the massive increases in regional populations of the tree-killing gypsy moth. Little traces the origins of all these forms of tree death to 150 years of full-throttle industrialization and then firmly reminds us that trees are essential to life on earth as we hope to live it. Sobering, responsible, and eloquent, this is an important book. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Reef Invertebrates: An Essential Guide to Selection, Care and Compatibility</h2><p>At 400 pages, this first volume of the Natural Marine Aquarium series takes a comprehensive look at the wide range of wondrous organisms both large and small for modern marine aquaria.

It sometimes seems that there are as many styles of houses as there are actual number of houses. While the earliest American houses were largely derived from English or Dutch prototypes, the diversity for which America is so celebrated soon emerged, reflecting mostly how Americans used their homes, as well as local and regional tastes and vernacular and folk origins from around the world. The variety and dynamism in the style of homes in that emerging pluralistic society marches on today in homes designed by adventuresome architects and clients.<br><br>In this extraordinary celebration of the American house, renowned author David Larkin, with commentary by some of today's leading architectural historians and critics, examines the paths that have led to distinctively American homes. Special attention is given to examining details of the makeup of each house as well as the functions of "the home" and how these functions have changed just as technology, social relations, and living arrangements have changed in the United States over the past 400 years.<br><br>Filled with more than 400 beautiful color photographs, this book also contains six double gatefolds, which offer dramatic presentations of the elements and details that make up the variety of architectural styles in American residential architecture. No other illustrated history of the American house can come close to this full portrayal of the historical and stylistic ranges of the place we call "home."<br></p><p><b>David Larkin</b> is a renowned editor, author, and book designer.

In that year the standard feature expanded to five reels, inaugurating a decade of experimentation and innovation that established the basic cinematic art from which American cinema has never radically deviated. This survey documents 50 outstanding silent feature films which characterize that achievement. From the early extravagance of From the Manger to the Cross (1912; filmed in Egypt and Palestine) to Chaplin&#39;s first full-length starring feature The Kid (early 1921), America&#39;s great pioneer producers, directors, actors and technicians are represented in their first and some of their best work. Film historians Anthony Slide and Edward Wagenknecht provide for each film credits, synopsis, critical commentary, and above all stills -- 210 scenes, many never before seen, from films for which there is often no existing print. Stills and commentary cover: The Count of Monte Cristo (1913). Traffic in Souls (1913)-Perhaps the first sexploitation film. Tess of the Storm Country (1914)-Mary Pickford&#39;s vehicle to stardom. The Bargain (1914)-William S. Hart&#39;s first great film role. A Fool There Was (1915)-Theda Bara as The Vamp. The Birth of a Nation (1915)-D.W. Griffith&#39;s controversial epic of the Ku Klux Klan. War Brides (1916)-Controversial pacifism, Nazimova&#39;s first. Joan the Woman (1916)-C.B. DeMille&#39;s first historical spectacular. Polly of the Circus (1918)- Samuel Goldwyn&#39;s first production. The Mark of Zorro (1920)-Douglas Fairbanks&#39; first swashbuckler. . plus some 40 more. America&#39;s earliest feature films are the focus of growing interest among cin�astes and scholars, who will appreciate the fund of documentation provided here. Film lovers of all generations will delight in the rare stills of John Barrymore as Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Geraldine Farrar as Carmen, Billie Burke, Lillian Gish, Francis X. Bushman, Norma Talmadge, Mabel Normand, Lon Chaney and even Rudolph Valentino as a low gigolo.</p><p></p><h2>Pocket Guide to Irish Genealogy</h2><p>By skillfully blending case studies, maps, charts, and his own mastery of the subject, Mitchell has managed to convey the basics of Irish genealogical research in scarcely sixty pages. Following introductory chapters on the background to research on the American side, the author describes the nature and uses of all significant record sources in Ireland, including but not limited to civil and parish registers, gravestone inscriptions, wills, the Griffith&#39;s Valuation, tithe books, the 1901 and 1911 censuses, newspapers, hearth money rolls, the registry of deeds, estate records, and ordnance survey memoirs. Another important chapter explains the differences between the various administrative divisions of Ireland, knowledge of which is critical in tracking down all available records on Irish ancestors. The Pocket Guide concludes with lists of all major Irish record offices and heritage centers, providing addresses and phone numbers, hours of operation, contact persons, and major record holdings. In short, if you need a handy road map to genealogical research in Ireland, look no further.</p><p>Genealogical research is often viewed as complex and arduous. "The basic aim of this book is to overcome the perception that genealogy is only for the experts." Mitchell accomplishes his task well. This short guide explains the genealogical history of Ireland and how to find and use the sources that describe American's ancestors. Sections on administrative divisions, record offices, and heritage centers in Ireland make finding sources easy. There are illustrations of major sources and how to extract information from them. This book will be more useful to beginning hobbyists than the longer treatments by Marilyn Yurdan ( Irish Family History , Genealogical Pub., 1990), and Angus Baxter ( In Search of Your British &amp; Irish Roots , LJ 11/15/82; Genealogical Pub., 1987. reprint). It could be improved by adding a short bibliography on Irish history and sources. Recommended for libraries serving genealogists or collecting manuals for hobbyists.<br><i>- Raymond S.

She was five feet seven with mahogany skin and a beautiful smile. She was born in Fort Worth, Texas, but spent most of her childhood in Detroit. She was a people person, with excellent soft skills, and she rarely made anything less than a great first impression when she wanted to.<br><br> But I could never take her words at face value. When I was about four years old she sat me down and told me in graphic detail what my father had done that forced her to leave him. She sat, unblinking, her face mere inches from mine. "Your father," she said slowly through clenched teeth, drawing each word out as she gestured with the lit cigarette that dangled from between her fingers, "took me by my shoulders and threw me down on the ground. He pinned me there, Zachary," she continued, "calling me a fucking bitch and holding me down with all his strength until I could hardly breathe."<br><br> I was terrified. I didn't want to hear any more, but even at the age of four I knew better than to interrupt my mother when she was speaking. "Then he picked me up," she said, her brow knit and eyes focused, "and threw me against the wall. It hurt to walk, but I ran into your room to get you so that we could leave. But your father blocked the doorway and refused to let us out."<br><br> I was later told that when my father left for work the next morning, my mother borrowed money from a friend to rent an apartment, and the two of us moved out of our house in Forestville, Maryland. For weeks, my dad had no idea where my mom and I were. During that time, she filled my head with lies about my father, repeating this violent, graphic story over and over with her voice and eyes full of fear and anger.<br><br> I had nightmares about my father knocking my mom over, slapping her, and throwing her to the ground. But had he done those things? My young mind was confused. The details of his beatings were there in my memory, but they didn't feel the same as other memories that I knew to be true. I couldn't tell what was real.<br><br> Finally, my mom's mom, whom I called Lola, convinced my mother to let me see my father again. I was so happy to be back home at his house, but I was also confused. All weekend, I wouldn't stop asking my father questions about what had happened between him and my mom. "Daddy, did you hurt Mommy? Did you hit her?"<br><br> "No," he said with a sigh. "That's not how I remember it." He never said she was lying. But I sensed from spending time with my father that her stories were biased. I loved being with my dad. He was at work a lot, but when he got home he'd throw some meat and vegetables into the oven and take me to the park to play. My dad has always been a gym rat. He's in great shape to this day, and when I was a kid he had at least as much energy as I did. And I always had a lot of energy.<br><br> This was how my dad showed his affection-by doing rather than saying. He was emotionally reserved but engaged, a man of few words. He rarely told me that he loved me, but he showed me clearly that he did by always being there, ready to play with me and make his best efforts at answering my endless questions. No matter how exhausted or frustrated he was, he never raised his voice. His house, which I still thought of as home, was a place of peace.<br><br> It was in direct contrast to life with my mom, and I missed my dad terribly when he wasn't around. A few months after we'd moved out of my dad's house, we were going through a drive-through when I told my mom, "I want to be with my dad."<br><br> Now, this memory is crystal clear. My mom took the bag of food and sped off, abruptly stopping the car a few yards away. She reached over to the passenger seat, grabbed me, and forcefully placed me in her lap. She put her hands on my shoulders and began shaking me aggressively.<br><br> "No, Zachary," she said over and over as she shook me. "No, no, no, no, no." I felt dizzy. "Tell me you love me." She kept on shaking me. My head was spinning. "Tell me that you want to live with me." I just cried. I was so scared. I had never seen her that angry. "Tell me, Zachary."<br><br> "Yes," I finally said in a small voice, and she abruptly stopped. I was still crying, and my head hurt, but she placed me back in my seat and drove off as if nothing had happened. I didn't say a word for the rest of the day.<br><br> When I think about these early memories, I try to reconcile them with the many times my mom said, "If you fail at raising your children, nothing else in life really matters." It was a paraphrase of her favorite quotation from Jacqueline Kennedy, whom she admired for her elegance and sophistication. When I think about the fear and pain I felt as a child, I try to remember the amazing birthday parties my mother threw for me and the times she sat me down one-on-one and said, "Zachary, I love you more than you will ever know. Honey, I love you more than life itself."<br><br> Even when I resented her for how she made me feel, I loved my mother dearly, just as I do now. As I look back, it's easier to see how as a little kid my mind was overwhelmed by the expectation of her rage. Though I never doubted that she loved me, the abuse I endured often made it difficult for me to feel her love.<br><br> Different people yell at varying levels of intensity-a raised voice, a shout, a quick holler. When my mother yelled, it was as if all her rage were being unleashed-and she had a lot of rage. She yelled with high intensity for as long as she could. Many times, she'd scream at me until her voice became hoarse. Then she'd take a break and start yelling again when her voice returned.<br><br> While she was yelling, I had to stand up straight and still and maintain eye contact with her the entire time. If I slouched or dropped my gaze, it would make things worse. Sometimes she'd yell while sitting back in her chair, smoking a cigarette. But most of the time, she would stand uncomfortably close to me, staring me right in the eyes. If I wasn't focusing enough on what she was saying, she'd point her finger right up to my eye, so close that it was almost touching. "Don't blink," she said sternly. "Don't you fucking blink."<br><br> I always looked forward to visits with my dad, but they were never frequent enough for me. The second-best thing was trips to see my grandma Lola and her husband, whom I called Papa, in Detroit. They were both retired, so they spent all their time with me when I visited. Lola had been an elementary school teacher for more than twenty years in the Detroit public school system, and Papa was a child psychologist.<br><br> Shortly after my third birthday, I went to stay with Lola and Papa for four weeks, and Lola taught me to read. I loved it, sitting there on her lap, watching her trace each word on the page with three fingers as she read to me.<br><br> Lola showered me with gifts and special treats. She promised that if I worked with her on my reading every morning, she would take me to Crossroads. Crossroads was short for Great Lakes Crossing Outlets mall. As a little kid, I thought it was absolutely the coolest place in the world. It was so big and was filled with a dizzying number of colors, contraptions, and curiosities. The mall had a Rainforest Cafe, with a life-size mechanical alligator that rose up out of the water and snapped its jaws when I walked up close to it. I was tempted to run up and smack it and then run away before it could bite me. I did this over and over again.<br><br> Crossroads also had the largest, most colorful, and most inviting play area I'd ever seen. Instead of a standard jungle gym, there were huge fruits and vegetables the size of SUVs made of glazed rubber for kids to climb, jump, and slide on. After I finished my reading, Lola took me to the mall and sat there watching me while I played. After I had spent all my energy, we got Bourbon chicken from our favorite place in the food court.<br><br> It took an hour to get to Crossroads from Lola's house, and during those rides back and forth she told me all about the trips she'd taken with Papa to western Europe, China, Japan, Russia, and South America. She explained to me that in different cultures, people valued different things, and that we shouldn't assume things about people until we understood their backgrounds. I rested my head on the car window, tired out from the long day of playing, and imagined the faces of the people who lived in these foreign countries. How were their lives similar to mine? I wondered. How were they different?<br><br> When I got back to DC after visiting Lola and Papa, my mom had a new boyfriend, Kevin. He was born and raised in Virginia. He was a relatively quiet man-dark skinned, short, and stocky with a strong work ethic. Kevin had a bald head and pimples that must have been with him since puberty. He was hard of hearing and tried to keep to himself, but my mom was always picking a fight with him. She made Kevin sleep in the basement and frequently told him he wasn�t a real man. For some reason he worshipped her and would do whatever she asked, whether it was to tell me bad things about my father, slash her boss�s tires, or beat up another guy who looked at her the wrong way. I was a child; I was completely dependent on my mom, and she made me believe that I would never be able to survive without her. But, hard as I tried, I never understood why Kevin stayed.<br><br> Kevin had a nephew named Warren who was around my age and often played at our house. One day when I was about five years old, Warren dared me to draw on the wall, and I did it. Of course, Warren immediately tattled to Kevin, who told my mom. After sending Kevin to take Warren home, she calmly told me, "Go get the flyswatter and take off your clothes."<br><br> Slowly, reluctantly, I did as she said. When I came back into the room, she pointed her finger right up to my eye. "You better not drop a fucking tear," she said before turning me around. I braced myself for what I knew was coming. Pow. Pow. Pow. This went on for several minutes until my whole backside was stinging. Then she stopped. She ordered me into her bedroom, turned off all the lights, and slammed the door closed.<br><br> Alone in the dark, I cried. I was afraid to lie on her bed, so I lay on the floor for hours. My mom came back into the room after midnight and started yelling. For hours, she told me what a disappointment I was, how ungrateful I was, how I didn't love her enough, and that I was just like my father.<br><br> It always went back to my father. Even in her calmer moments, she was fixated on my dad. She desperately wanted me to hate him, or to at least pretend that I did. She told me that if ever he took me away from her, she and Kevin would hang my father upside down and use a potato peeler to castrate him.<br><br> On nights like these, I went to bed wishing that I'd never wake up. I was too young to have any real understanding of death. I just wanted the pain to end. If she was this mad at me, I reasoned, then I must have been fundamentally bad, and maybe God was mad at me, too. I was afraid that if I did die, I'd go to hell, but I wasn't sure it would be much worse.<br><br> Early the next morning, my mom ran into my room and flipped on the lights singing the Green Acres theme song by Vic Mizzy at the top of her lungs.<br><br> "Mommy, I'm tired," I told her. I had barely slept the night before.<br><br> "Come on, buddy, wake up," she responded with a wide smile. "Sweet pea, Mama's pooh bear, a ziggity Zach-a Zach attack, sing it with me."<br><br> I closed my eyes, too exhausted to join in the fun. I knew that she wouldn't stop until I rolled over, gave her a kiss, and climbed out of bed. On days like this, instead of being angry or sad, she was full of energy and ready to have fun. These were the days I most looked forward to. My mom took me out to breakfast at Denny's or Bob Evans, and then we went to Chuck E. Cheese's and played arcade games for hours. She didn't just watch me play like the other moms. No, she was so into the experience that she even climbed around in the Sky Tubes, jumped in the ball pit, and went through the fun house with me. But our favorite game was Skee-Ball. We competed to see who could get the highest score, laughing and talking smack as we tried to outdo each other. But most of the time, she ended up letting me win.<br><br> After spending several hours at Chuck E. Cheese's, my mom took me to the movies. We paid for two tickets to whatever kids' movie was playing and then snuck into a second movie after that one ended. It was still daylight out after the second movie, so we went go-cart racing. My mom loved the go-carts. My feet didn't yet reach the pedals, so I just sat beside her as she drove, hooting and laughing the entire time.<br><br> After that, she let me choose where to go for dinner. I picked Famous Dave's, because they had the best barbecue in town. But my mom wasn't satisfied with the options offered in a single meal, so she ordered several large platters, far more than the two of us could possibly eat. Our last stop before heading home was at Baskin-Robbins for ice cream. I was completely stuffed, but I made sure to eat my ice cream, not wanting for a moment to seem ungrateful.</p><h2>Samuel Johnson : The Life of Writing</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Fresh, alert, commanding and likely to be a landmark in 18th century studies. . . .Readers who care about English literature will relish this lucid, often controversial re-examination.&#x201d; &#x2015;Book-of-the-Month-Club <em>News</em></strong></p> Not everyone is as innocent as this engaging complainant. Most people who read know something about Johnson, enough at least to summon up images of him asseverating &#x201c;No, Sir,&#x201d; knocking back endless cups of tea, rambling over the Hebrides, puffing out his breath like a whale, repressing Boswell, standing bareheaded in Uttoxeter Market, and having a frisk with Beauclerk and Langton. And now, thanks to the Johnsonians of Yale, Columbia, Oxford, and Lichfield, our knowledge of the man and his social environment has increased more than anyone fifty years ago could have imagined. But despite prodigies of research and documentation, an interest in Johnson that could be called literary has been wanting. One suspects that for every hundred persons familiar with the classic Johnson anecdotes there is perhaps only one who has actually read the <em>Rambler</em> or the <em>Idler</em> or even the <em>Lives of the Poets</em>. And if the writings are still little read for their own sake, they are almost as little written about as attractive objects of criticism. Yale&#x2019;s new edition of the writings, the first since the early nineteenth century, is an occasion to perceive that for all his value as conversational goad and wit and for all his attractiveness as a moral and religious hero, Johnson&#x2019;s identity remains stubbornly that of a writer.</p><p></p><h2>The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths</h2><p>A retelling of the Norse sagas about Odin, Freya, Thor, Loki and the other gods and goddesses who lived in Asgard before the dawn of history.</p><p>Padraic Colum (1881&#x2013;1972) was a poet, a playwright, and a leader of the Irish Renaissance, but he is best known for his works for children, including <i>The Children of Odin</i> and <i>The Golden Fleece</i> (a Newbery Honor Book).<br><br>William Andrew ("Willy") Pogany (August 1882 &#x2013; 30 July 1955) was a prolific Hungarian illustrator of children's and other books.</p><h2>I Hate to Cook Book</h2><p>A collection of 180 recipes and kitchen and household hints for the woman who does not like to cook</p><p></p><h2>Tin mosques &amp; ghantowns: A history of Afghan cameldrivers in Australia</h2><p>Apart from the Chinese, the Afghans were the earliest non-European immigrants to Australia.

This stunning album, which weds superb color reproductions to a perspicacious, lively text, goes far beyond Edouard Vuillard's marvelous room interiors, Maurice Denis's visions of slender women in long dresses, and Pierre Bonnard's illusionist renderings of moments of daily life. Tracing the Nabis' intricate friendships, love lives, theories and influences ranging from Gauguin to Japanese prints, the authors show how this Parisian art movement matured as it welcomed into its fold the Dutch Jan Verkade, the Swiss Felix Valloton, the Hungarian Jozsef Rippl-Ronai and the Dane Mogens Ballin. The book also provides striking visual evidence that the Nabis did some of their most original work in graphics, tapestries, screens, watercolors on fans, furniture bas-reliefs and theater design. Freches-Thory is a curator at Paris's Musee d'Orsay; Terrasse is author of Pierre Bonnard. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Boundaries: How the Mason-Dixon Line Settled a Family Feud and Divided a Nation</h2><p><b>The Mason-Dixon Line&#x2019;s history, replete with property disputes, persecution, and ideological conflicts, traverses our country&#x2019;s history from its founding to today. </b><br><br>We live in a world of boundaries &#x2014; geographic, scientific, cultural, and religious.

It is also where some of democracy's greatest virtues clash with its worst vices: idealism and compromise meet corruption and bitter partisanship. The American Congress unveils the rich and varied history of this singular institution.<br> Julian E. Zelizer has gathered together forty essays by renowned historians to capture the full drama, landmark legislation, and most memorable personalities of Congress. Organized around four major periods of congressional history, from the signing of the Constitution to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, this volume brings a fresh perspective to familiar watershed events: the Civil War, Watergate, the Vietnam War. It also gives a behind-the-scenes look at lesser-known legislation debated on the House and Senate floors, such as westward expansion and war powers control. Here are the stories behind the 1868 vote to impeach President Andrew Johnson; the rise of Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress and a leading advocate for pacifism; and the controversy surrounding James Eastland of Mississippi, who carried civil rights bills in his pockets so they could not come up for a vote. Sidebars further spotlight notables including Huey Long, Sam Rayburn, and Tip O'Neill, bringing the sweeping history of our lawmaking bodies into sharp focus.<br> If you've ever wondered how Congress worked in the past or what our elected officials do today, this book gives the engaging, often surprising, answers.</p><p>Julian E.

Approximately twelve feet square with an elaborately decorated ceiling, the walls were covered with signed photographs of famous politicians, a formal portrait of Rayburn, the flags of Texas and the United States, and a few of Rayburn&#x2019;s favorite cartoons. Sitting in an oversized chair that stood behind a long desk, the taciturn Rayburn would loosen up as he talked with the Democratic colleagues who made up his inner circle. They ranged in age and ideology from the abrasive and aggressive Georgian Eugene Cox a staunch anti New Deal conservative who nonetheless helped Rayburn as a powerful Democrat on the House Rules Committee to the populist Texan Wright Patman, who was so trusted that he received a personal key to the room. Even though he was physically small and unassuming, Rayburn commanded enormous respect by relying on informal relationships to influence decisions in an era when southern committee chairs dominated the chamber. Lewis Deschler, the House Parliamentarian whose immense knowledge of parliamentary procedure made him an invaluable asset to Rayburn, was a fixture at these gatherings. A few trusted news reporters attended, but only under the strict understanding that conversations were off the record. While drinking bourbon and playing cards on the long leather couch and eight chairs that filled the room, Democrats debated the nation&#x2019;s biggest issues.<br> The Board of Education is a landmark in congressional history. Scholars of Congress speak about this room with the same respect shown when presidential experts discuss the Oval Office. It was in this room that a deeply divided Democratic party hashed out difficult compromises on controversial issues ranging from Cold War foreign policy to civil rights for African Americans. This was where Vice President Harry Truman received the call to become president in 1945 when Franklin Roosevelt passed away and where the young Lyndon Johnson strove to ingratiate himself with the Speaker&#x2019;s drinking circle. In many ways it was like the closed rooms of other congressional eras: a place where senators and representatives could meet and do the hard business of a legislature: discuss, deal, compromise, and finally agree to act on the nation&#x2019;s problems.<br> Yet the Board of Education, and the individuals who met there, have generally escaped historical attention. Overshadowed by presidents and social movements, legislators remain ghosts in America&#x2019;s historical imagination. Tourists visiting Washington, D.C., enter the White House with a strong sense of the history of the presidents who lived there. Many Americans are familiar with the lineage linking George Washington to George W. Bush. Although the Supreme Court is less familiar, a popular narrative centers on the Chief Justices. Unlike the presidency and Supreme Court, however, Congress remains much of a mystery. While many Americans know about a handful of prominent representatives and senators, few have been exposed to a history of the institution as a whole. Most individuals are likely to think of Congress as an amorphous, messy, and chaotic body. At worst, many envision the Congress as depicted in the film Bulworth, in which Warren Beatty plays a senator who once marched for civil rights but who had been morally destroyed by an institution dominated by corrupt individuals and crooked interest groups. Some experts lament that Congress is not what it used to be, but they seem to have little sense of what those times were actually like.<br> This lack of knowledge is unfortunate. Congress is the heart and soul of our democracy, the arena where politicians and citizens most directly interact over pressing concerns. Frequently, commentators joke that legislation resembles sausage: the taste may be good, but people do not want to see how it was made. The very messiness of congressional decisions, which is often lamented by commentators, reflects the diversity and richness of the nation. As the Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson once argued: Government is like a pump and what it pumps up is just what we are, a fair sample of the intellect, the ethics, and the morals of the people no better, no worse.&#x201d; In Congress, grand policy proposals are created by politicians responding to the nation&#x2019;s economic, social, sectional, cultural, and political interests. Its members attempt to placate diverse portions of the population and broker complicated compromises between the myriad of voices to find concrete solutions to the nation&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019;s most pressing problems. The histories of the House and Senate demonstrate the great virtue of the legislative process is, namely, its ability to create innovative policies through difficult compromise. Yet Congress has also been the source of democracy&#x2019;s greatest vices, plagued by scandal, insular deliberations, rampant corruption, and bitter partisanship.<br> The size, messiness, virtues, and vices that make Congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution. Unlike the presidency, Congress is difficult to conceptualize, with up to 535 members who are constantly rotating in and out. In many respects, moreover, the House and Senate are two distinct institutions, each with its own story. In contrast to the presidency, where the succession of individual leaders creates its own chronological narrative, the structure of Congress makes the crafting of a coherent history challenging.<br> Furthermore, there are many histories of Congress. For example, there is the internal development of the legislative process (committees, seniority, norms, etc.), as well as the relationship between internal process and external forces. There is also the question of leadership, in its many forms. For example, one study might focus on the history of party leaders in Congress, but another could center on the formidable and independent role played by committee chairs or independent mavericks. As a result, historians have focused on specific legislators and on critical conflicts at different moments in congressional history.<br> Given all these complications, we believe the best way to understand congressional history is to study the institution in action and what has emerged from that action. Because its job is to make law, the successes and failures of Congress can best be understood by examining seminal moments, when legislators had to make important decisions. Written by thirty-nine of the nation&#x2019;s leading historians and political scientists, the chapters in The American Congress therefore revolve around events, not individuals, although each chapter also covers a broad range of legislators, procedural issues, and policies that defined Congress at different moments. Thus, the collective nature of Congress, rather than the individual- centered history that is more appropriate for the presidency, is underscored. Seen from this legislative perspective, many of the events with which we are most familiar such as the Constitutional Convention, slavery, or the New Deal look quite different.<br> Despite the diverse issues and approaches that make up the history of Congress in this volume (and the conflicting interpretations among the authors), several themes recur. One is the changing relationship between the legislative, judicial, and executive branches, which has been a defining tension in American politics. We see how Congress evolved from the time it was the central institution in government to the period when legislators fought for power with an expanded executive branch in the twentieth century, as well as an assertive judiciary that was willing to interfere in legislative business. Another theme, just as significant, will be the importance of the internal structure of the House and Senate to legislative history. In Congress, policy and process have always been intertwined, and changes in the internal structure have been dramatic.<br> A third theme is the changes in the intermediary institutions the vital organizations such as political parties, civic associations, interest groups, and the mass media through which citizens and politicians have communicated. Since the American Revolution, the nature and power of these organizations have shifted, and the story of Congress has shifted with them.<br> Another theme is political power. We will show that Congress has not been a solely reactive institution, entering the political fray only after the president, courts, or events have initiated action. Rather, Congress has always played an active role in shaping politics, government policy, and public life.<br> A fifth theme is that Congress has been an active force. Many historians have downplayed the role of Congress because they see it as a passive institution whose members usually react to the pressure bearing down on them. To understand the prime movers in American political history, historians have looked to the White House, experts, or to social movements. But in fact, although Congress is extraordinarily sensitive to democratic pressure, the members of Congress have also been able to initiate their own policy proposals, develop their own agendas and interests, and form their own distinct institutional identity. Indeed, the search and evolution of this identity have been at the heart of congressional history.<br> Sixth, many of the essays touch on an ongoing controversy about the nature of representative government everywhere: should legislators simply voice directly the desires of the citizens they represent, or should they decide what policies would be best for the nation and its citizens? This vexing issue, which dates back to at least the sixteenth- and seventeenth- century English debates over the role of Parliament, has been a constant source of controversy that plays out in battles over the institutional structure of Congress and the legislation it passes.<br> A final question is one of historical framework. How shall we describe the different eras of congressional history? Surely today&#x2019;s Senate and House are very different from those of the 1790s, and each has gone through a process of evolution. Yet, as most of the essays in this collection reveal, congressional time does not follow the more familiar rhythms of American politics, which center on individual leaders, dominant ideologies and parties, major public policies, or social movements. Making matters more complicated, the elections of legislators are staggered, the institution is composed of two distinct chambers, there is no titular head or unified leadership in a split body with hundreds of members, and Congress handles an enormous number of issues that are often unrelated except for the process through which they travel. So, how to think of the lifetime of Congress?<br> I believe that historical periods in America&#x2019;s Congress are best defined by the changing nature of the legislative process itself. The periods of congressional history gain their flavor from the formal and informal rules of the game,&#x201d; the process and the structures through which all participants operate and all decisions are made. The legislative process of any given congressional era has been much more than a technical backdrop&#x201d; to the real political action. The way in which the nation&#x2019;s elected officials have structured Congress to solve problems says a great deal about the character of the nation&#x2019;s representative democracy.<br> In this context, it is helpful to think of Congress as an automobile. While drivers of various skills can take the automobile in different directions on various types of roads, the internal machinery of the vehicle plays a crucial role in determining how smooth the drive will be, as well as how far and fast the driver can go. Each particular process, moreover, favors certain types of policies. Each generation of legislators and their leadership become closely identified to the legislative process through which they worked.<br> There have been four major eras in American congressional history: the formative era (1790s 1820s); the partisan era (1830s 1900s); the committee era (1910s 1960s); and the contemporary era (1970s today). In this book, the procedural framework is meant to be much broader than the relative power of committees and caucuses. It includes the political environment in which legislators governed, such as the structure of the news media, interest groups, social movements, and political parties. In the introductions to the sections of this book, we shall look in detail at the nature of each era. It is important to note that the eras did not begin and end with any type of precision. Rather, each evolved gradually, usually built on top of the previous one, rather than replacing wholesale what came before. As a result, the process that shaped each era contained remnants of what preceded it.<br> So let us begin our exploration of the American Congress. I hope that once readers have completed this book, Sam Rayburn&#x2019;s Board of Education won&#x2019;t seem so foreign and its place in the trajectory of congressional history will seem much more familiar. Given the vast size of the institution and the lengthy amount of time that is covered in this collection, it is of course not a complete history of Congress. Many personalities and events could not be included. Regardless, we believe the breadth of the essays captures many of the major issues that the legislative branch has confronted and the struggles that took place within its halls. We begin this exciting excursion during the writing of the Constitution, when the nation&#x2019;s Founders struggled over what role the legislative branch should have in the national polity, and we end with recent decades, when a grass-roots conservative movement tried to take advantage of a legislative institution dominated by partisanship and scandal. In the end, we hope to show that, with all of its vices and flaws, Congress has been a critical institution in this nation&#x2019;s history; it has given life to the meaning of democracy and offered an arena in which to tackle some of our greatest challenges.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Houghton Mif&#xfb02;in Company.

Speaking to the cultural and religious concerns of the period, these essays made Holmes famous on both sides of the Atlantic. <br><br>Author William C. Dowling brings together literary criticism, philosophy, and the history of science to re-examine the Breakfast Table Trilogy through the lens of what Holmes learned as a medical student in Paris in the 1830s--during the Paris revolution in clinical teaching that laid the foundations of modern medicine. There, the young Holmes gained the experience that would eventually manifest so richly in the Breakfast Table Trilogy, which Dowling argues was the major American contribution to the literature of Victorian religious anxiety, keeping company with the works of Tennyson and Carlyle.<br><br>Though based on the uncompromising philosophical materialism of such works as La Mettrie's L'Homme machine, his experiences in Paris would ultimately suggest to Holmes an alternative view of the bleak physical universe brought into view by Lyell's Principles of Geology and Darwin's Origin of Species. In the Breakfast Table Trilogy, as well as in the writings he produced during his career at Harvard Medical School, Holmes would argue that science, as much as art, music, or literature, was the creation of a human consciousness existing outside or beyond purely physical laws. Holmes's metaphysics of consciousness, Dowling maintains, accounts for his enormous impact on readers on both sides of the Atlantic during the later nineteenth century. In his Paris medical studies lie the hidden origins of that religio medici, or "physician's religion," that would subsequently permit Holmes, in the pages of The Atlantic Monthly, to emerge as spiritual physician to an age of religious doubt.<br><br>"In Dowling's narrative, one can virtually see Holmes developing into the great physician, anatomist, teacher and thinker he would eventually become, all written . . . from the perspective not only of medical theory but also the atmosphere and worldview born out of the zeitgeist to which he was exposed during his time in Paris. This is as much a philosophy book as it is a biography, a study of a distinctive period in medical history or a panoramic and yet intimate survey of early nineteenth-century Paris.

In the first period, political and economic stabilization brings forth a mood of confident expectation which expresses itself in literature, art, and philosophy, all reaching for a goal of "self-centered aesthetic harmony." In the second period, a series of foreign invasions shatters the political and economic well-being of the Indian elite but does not slow down the artistic and literary drive. Whether in hope or in sorrow, in response to shock or in escape from reality, the Renaissance attains its glorious climax. The third period is torn between conflicting tendencies. The political battle is lost but there is a second economic revival; art and literature give out despondent notes but successfully explore new channels; philosophic permissiveness comes to an end but scientific reserach comes into its own. Mr. Lopez's tripartition of an age which is usually described as a single sweep adds depth to the definition of the Italian Renaissance. It is enhanced by his fresh translations of Renaissance poems and by twenty-four illustrations which pick out from the incomparable wealth of Renaissance art a few historically significant works. All the famous names are there, from Lorenzo de'Medici to Ariosto, Machiavelli, and Cardano, from Botticelli to Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Palladio; but one also meets a large number of minor figures and anonymous people in the street. America is discovered; new diseases appear; anti-Semitism reawakens; religious unity is destroyed - these and other events form the backdrop. The sparkling narration is thoroughly grounded in contemporary sources.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Invisible Sex: Uncovering the True Roles of Women in Prehistory</h2><p><p>Shaped by cartoons and museum dioramas, our vision of Paleolithic times tends to feature fur-clad male hunters fearlessly attacking mammoths while timid women hover fearfully behind a boulder. In fact, recent research has shown that this vision bears little relation to reality.</p><p>The field of archaeology has changed dramatically in the past two decades, as women have challenged their male colleagues' exclusive focus on hard artifacts such as spear points rather than tougher to find evidence of women's work.

In <em>The Invisible Sex</em>, the authors present an exciting new look at prehistory, arguing that women invented all kinds of critical materials, including the clothing necessary for life in colder climates, the ropes used to make rafts that enabled long-distance travel by water, and nets used for communal hunting.

This oversize volume captures the lush atmosphere and isolation of the men and women working in the California pornographic industry through the eyes of one of its most brilliant observers.</p><p>Jeff Burton has profited from working in the porn industry for almost twenty years, towing its seemingly paradoxical strict docu-aesthetic line: he never crops his photographs nor are they ever manipulated; any staging is the result of the labor and art direction available at the scene or on the set - no longer in his photographs &#39;staged&#39; but things in the world. -Bruce Hainley</p><h2>The Leopard</h2><p>Lampedusa&#39;s masterpiece, one of the finest works of twentieth century fiction, is set amongst an aristocratic family, facing social and political changes in the wake of Garibaldi&#39;s invasion of Sicily in 1860. At the head of the family is the prince, Don Fabrizio. Proud and stubborn, he is accustomed to knowing his own place in the world and expects his household to run accordingly. He is aware of the changes which are rapidly making men historically obsolete but he remains attached to the old ways. His favourite nephew, Tancredi, may be an ardent supporter of Garibaldi and may later marry outside his class, but Don Fabrizio will make few accommodations for the modern world. Containing, for the first time in any language, the full original text, Tomasi di Lampedusa&#39;s classic tale lovingly memorialises the details of a vanishing world while retaining its melancholic and ironic sense of time passing and the frailty of human emotions.</p><p><i>The Leopard</i> is set in Sicily in 1860, as Italian unification is coming violently into being, but it transcends the historical-novel classification. E.M. Forster called it, instead, "a novel which happens to take place in history." Lampedusa's Sicily is a land where each social gesture is freighted with nuance, threat, and nostalgia, and his skeptical protagonist, Don Fabrizio, is uniquely placed to witness all and alter absolutely nothing. Like his creator, the prince is an aristocrat and an astronomer, a man "watching the ruin of his own class and his own inheritance without ever making, still less wanting to make, any move toward saving it." Far better to take refuge in the night skies. <p> What renders <i>The Leopard</i> so beautiful, and so despairing, is Lampedusa's grasp of human frailty and his vision of Sicily's arid terrain--"comfortless and irrational, with no lines that the mind could grasp, conceived apparently in a delirious moment of creation; a sea suddenly petrified at the instant when a change of wind had flung waves into frenzy." Though the author had long had the book in mind, he didn't begin writing it until he was in his late 50s. He died at 60, soon after it was rejected as unpublishable. </p><p> Archibald Colquhoun's lyrical translation also contains 70 more precious pages of Lampedusa--a memoir, a short story, and the first chapter of a novel. In "Places of My Infancy" the author warns that "the reader (who won't exist) must expect to be led meandering through a lost Earthly Paradise. If it bores him. I don't mind." Luckily, the reader does exist; even more luckily, boredom is not an option.</p>A classic of modern fiction.

It examines the theological, historical, and Biblical basis for "premillennial dispensationalism", the belief system based around the Rapture, and popularized in the best-selling Left Behind books and taught by "Bible prophecy" writers Tim LaHaye, Hal Lindsey, Jack Van Impe, and many others. <p>Written for both the lay person and the serious student, this book combines an engaging, popular approach with detailed footnotes and exhaustive research. Beginning with the big picture, it focuses first on key concepts such as eschatology, the Parousia, and the relationship between the Kingdom and the Church. It then examines the Book of Revelation, providing insights into the nature and purpose of that difficult, final book of the Bible. Another chapter looks at the concept of the "millennium" and how it has been understood by various Christians over the centuries. Olson then shows how Left Behind creator LaHaye&#x2019;s many works of "Bible prophecy" are filled with attacks on Catholicism, and often rely on sensationalism, shaky scholarship, and subjective interpretations of Scripture </p><p>Olson, a former dispensationalist who now edits Envoy magazine, also presents a history of apocalyptic belief and theology, beginning with the Early Church Fathers and including the Montanists, St. Augustine, Joachim of Fiore, the Protestant Reformers, and the American Puritans. He shows how John Nelson Darby, an ex-Anglican priest, developed the premillennial dispensationalist system, which hinges on the Rapture, in the 1830s and how Darby relied upon faulty assumptions about Jesus Christ, the Church, and the Bible. </p><p>The second part of the book, "A Catholic Critique of Dispensationalism," focuses on three important topics: the relationship between Israel, the Church, and the Kingdom; the interpretation of Scripture; and the nature of the Rapture event. Filled with a wealth of information drawn from both Protestant and Catholic sources, this section provides a complete rebuttal to the premillennial dispensationalist system and the "left behind" theology. The book concludes with a reflection on the Catholic understanding of the end times, salvation history, and the final judgement. Glossaries of key persons and terms are also included. </p><p>A strong, but fair, critique of a dangerous and popular belief, Will Catholics Be "Left Behind"? provides Catholics and Protestants, lay people and clergy, and students and scholars with important answers and information about the roots and meaning of the "Rapture".</p>I believe, as a former Fundamentalist and dispensationalist who entered the Catholic Church in 1997, that the real depths of dispensationalism and all of its dangers has not yet been understood by the vast majority of Catholics (and not a few Protestants). <p>The success of the Left Behind books (about 57 million now in print) and their impact on Catholics (Tyndale Press estimates that 11% of Left Behind readers are Catholic) indicates that this book needed to be written. Many scholars believed that dispensationalism died in the 1980s, but its influence at the grassroots level can hardly be overstated. Most Fundamentalists and many Evangelicals embrace dispensationalism, or at least elements of it (the "Rapture" being the most obvious example). These same people and groups have a generally negative view of the Catholic Church and view Catholics as either non-Christian or nominally-Christian people who need to "be saved" from the supposed errors and evils of the Catholic Church. </p><p>Dispensationalist literature such as the Left Behind books or the works of Hal Lindsey present a complete worldview. They are not just concerned with the "end times," but with interpreting Scripture, understanding the work and person of Jesus Christ, articulating the Gospel, and presenting a particular notion of "Church." Dispensationalist teachings about Christ, salvation, the Bible, the Church, and the Kingdom all contain serious errors that stand in stark contrast to Catholic doctrine. My book details those errors, using extensive quotes from dispensationalists and non-dispensationalist Protestants, and compares them to official Church teaching.</p></p><h2>The Sirius Mystery: Conclusive New Evidence of Alien Influence on the Origins of Humankind in the Traditions of an African Tribe</h2><p>Is the existence of civilization on Earth a result of contact from inhabitants of a planet in the sysyem of the star Sirius prior to 3000 BC?

That is, both animals can and do derive valuable nutrition from the voluntary consumption of meat. In this regard, many mammals, including people, pigs, bears, raccoons, and myriad others have seemingly similar carnivorous tendencies. When meat is available, such animals will take advantage of the situation and eat it. There is a significant difference between cats and all of these other mammals, however. Dogs, people, pigs, bears, and raccoons, etc., are all omnivores that eat meat when it is available. Cats, big and small, are <i>obligatory</i> carnivores. The omnivore does not eat meat as a mandatory requirement for life; vegetable food sources can make up a very large part of their diet, and may even be properly balanced to provide all needed nutrients for health. For the cat, however, meat, and the nutrients found only in meat, are essential for survival.The Cat Is Not a Small DogCritical differences between dogs and cats, the most popular of all household pet animals, are clearly illustrated in the genetic, anatomic, and metabolic differences between the two. Scientists who have studied the dietary habits of carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores tell us that these "rungs" on the food-chain were established and reinforced during the evolutionary histories of each type of animal (see www.catinfo.org/zorans_article.pdf). The work of these experts suggests that the members of the superfamily <i>Feloidea,</i> including today's cat, evolved rapidly in distant prehistoric times, but then stopped abruptly in that progression. Carnivorous animals belonging to other families of animals, including the <i>Canoidea,</i> to which the dog belongs, seem to have progressed beyond this point to meet changing evolutionary needs.Good evidence for the cat's relatively ancient nature can be found in the lower number of chromosomes in its genetic makeup, compared with a much larger number for the group that includes modern dogs. The cat's cells carry thirty-eight chromosomes, while the dog's cells carry seventy-eight. This does not mean that the cat lacks physical and genetic sophistication equal to the dog. It means that it made a perfect and permanent fit within its spot in the environment early on and experienced little additional pressure to change its genes.Dogs and cats also have remarkably different, but highly specialized, anatomy. Dogs have forty-two permanent teeth, whereas cats have only thirty. Dogs have more molars than do cats, with a specialized shape for crushing, associated with their intake of plant material. In contrast, the shape of feline teeth is specialized for grasping and tearing flesh. By its structure, the cat's jaw has far more restricted side-to-side and front-to-back mobility than does the dog's, limiting its ability to grind a varied vegetation-containing diet as the dog can do. The cat's eyes and ears are positioned forward on the head to provide exquisite acuity of vision and hearing when tracking prey, particularly at night. Retractable claws, seen on cats but not dogs, are another specialized feature of an animal that must chase, catch, and bring down all of its food in the form of wild prey.The gastrointestinal tracts of the two species are also quite different. Those differences emphasize the differences in the natural diets of each. Science tells us that modifications in the basic structure of this important organ system from species to species are closely connected to diet. The cat's stomach, caecum (appendix), and colon, segments of the gastrointestinal tract most associated with digestion of vegetable matter, are smaller than those segments in the dog. The length of the feline intestine in proportionto its body length is short compared with that of the dog, indicating that the cat's evolutionary diet was highly digestible (protein and fat), whereas the dog consumes far more vegetable matter. The inner lining of the cat's stomach has significantly greater surface area than does the same part of the dog's stomach. Anatomists believe that increases in the relative size of this stomach area are an adaptation to the digestion of higher-meat, more calorie-dense diets. The caecum in the cat is very primitive, whereas it is much better developed in the dog. Once again, this portion of the gastrointestinal tract assists in the processing of fibrous, nonmeat dietary constituents.Equally telling of the cat's strictly carnivorous origins are its nutrient requirements, especially its requirements for protein. Research done on the 1970s and '80s showed conclusively that protein requirements in kittens and cats far exceed those of puppies or dogs. The cat, unlike omnivores such as the dog, "burns" protein to make energy for its everyday use, under all circumstances. Most other animals burn large amounts of protein for energy only when protein is plentiful in the diet.In contrast, the cat has an ongoing high requirement for protein to turn into energy, even when dietary protein intake is very limited. During starvation or excessive protein-restriction, the cat is forced to disassemble its body's own constituent proteins (enzymes, antibodies, organ tissues, and so on) to produce fuel for energy to keep the cells alive and functioning. Thus, in the most fundamental way, the health and tissue integrity of the cat is dependent upon the continual intake of highly digestible protein, especially protein from meat.Another of the cat's claims to the top-predator spot in the food chain is the absolute requirement for an essential fatty acid, arachidonic acid, found only in meat. Also, cats must consume preformed vitamin A from animal-source foods because they are unable to make this essential vitamin from the beta carotene found in plants. The list of the specializations of the cat's internal machinery that reflect its evolutionary adaptations to a life as an obligatory carnivore goes on and on.Not All Livers Are AlikeBy far, the most fascinating characteristic of the cat compared to omnivores like the dog is the manner in which its liver functions. The cat's very high protein and amino acid requirements arise from the constantly high activity of certain enzymes in the feline liver. These enzymes disassemble the amino acids in protein to make them available for productionof energy in a process called <i>gluconeogenesis.</i> Essentially, the liver is the organ that is responsible for the high and constant burn rate of protein in the cat's body. Omnivores such as the dog have a liver that is also capable of this function, but omnivores turn the rate of this function up or down depending on how much dietary protein is available. In contrast, the cat's liver protein "burn rate" is set high at all times, even when dietary protein is scarce or entirely absent. Death from protein starvation can be very rapid in this species.In the liver, protein amino acids are processed into glucose (sugar) and sent into the bloodstream to supply the body's need for this energy nutrient. In a meat-eating species like the cat, accustomed to little dietary carbohydrate in its evolutionary environment, the liver will manufacture the great majority of the animal's needed glucose, which is the primary energy supply for the animal's brain. Because there is little glucose in a high-meat diet, this is an essential task for an obligatory carnivore. The liver of omnivores, including people and dogs, have multiple enzyme systems for handling dietary carbohydrate; the cat has only one such enzyme system, with limited capacity to deal with high carbohydrate consumption.Such specializations make the cat fit its niche perfectly; indeed, the fittest animal in a niche will be the one with the fewest and simplest systems to meet its survival needs. The cat's ancestors did not need the ability to turn their liver's protein burn rate up and down. Similarly, they did not require significant carbohydrate-handling capabilities. The specialized glucose-from-protein systems that have been genetically retained by the modern cat are always active at a high rate, obligating felines to eat more protein than their omnivorous counterparts. Because of this, unfortunately, the cat will suffer far more harm than will omnivores in situations where protein is insufficient or absent. We will see how important this requirement is when we discuss many of the common diseases of our pet cats.Out of AfricaThe present-day house cat (<i>Felis domesticus</i>) is generally thought to have descended thousands of years ago from a small wild cat (<i>Felis lybica</i>) native to the deserts of North Africa. Such a dry climate heritage would explain many distinct characteristics of this species. Cats are capable of surviving for long periods without water, and will naturally consume very little free water when they are feeding on canned cat food or fresh meat.Cats can produce urine that is highly concentrated compared to that of the dog and other animals that evolved in more water-rich environments. The cat's natural tendency to produce urine with a great deal of metabolic waste in a highly concentrated form can be dangerous if a cat feeds on a diet that is low in water, because this desert animal has a naturally low thirst drive. The cat that is consuming dry cat food seldom drinks enough additional free water to balance the dry state of the food. This results in especially concentrated urine with attendant medical problems, including certain kinds of bladder disease. Dry food also contains ingredients that interfere with the natural acidity of the cat's urine. Highly concentrated, alkaline urine from dry food consumption is associated with serious, even fatal urinary tract problems.The Predator LifestyleThe cat's ancient predator-behaviors are very much a part of its present-day life. Some wild cat species live solitary lives, associating closely with other adults of their species only during mating season. The most familiar of such solitary wild cats is the mountain lion, or cougar (<i>Felis concolor</i>). Other species, such as the African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i>), live relatively sedentary lives in small groups of animals, hunting and caring for the young in a collective manner, with a very defined geography that belongs to each group and which is protected by the group from outsiders that might take resources from that territory. Our pet cats are still very influenced by the primal behavioral instincts of their wild ancestors.The domestic cat is like the lion in its social orientation. Despite the common belief that house cats are aloof and solitary, most naturally prefer to have companionship with a few members of their species. In such groups, which claim set territory with well understood boundaries, there is a clear pecking order, with the leader, or "alpha cat," often a female, living communally with its associates that have decreasing amounts of influence within the group. As long as the range of this group is large enough for the group size, there is general harmony, with only minor dominance "debates" between the alpha and associates.From time to time, however, there may be individuals that do not fit with the group as a whole. For reasons that are not often clear, a young adult may become a pariah, or outcast. Such pariahs are individuals that cannot find friendship with the other cats in the community; rather, they will be chased and sometimes attacked by even other low-levelmembers of the group. In the wild setting, such cats would either leave the colony and seek other outcasts with which to start a new colony, or would live at the edge of the group, finding food and shelter as best they could without interacting with the others. Sometimes a youngster, often a male, will suddenly begin to demonstrate inappropriate and persistent dominance behaviors relative to others with high and low positions within the hierarchy. Dominant behaviors from a nonalpha cat are very disruptive of the welfare of the group and such a cat would also be driven from the colony, unless it can win the battles with older, more established members of the group and take their place in the hierarchy.Feral cat colonies typically have clusters of same-sex cats that associate most closely. Females of reproductive age spend time together, and naturally their young kittens stay close to this female grouping until some time after they are weaned. Young adult males associate with one another in a sort of "bachelor band," but this group does not intermingle much with the females because one or a few older, more dominant males do the breeding that takes place within the colony. Dominant males live more solitary lives, except during the breeding season. Breeding males are highly competitive with one another, and each maintains a subterritory that is his own within the colony. Serious fights occur when a young male or another breeding male invades the well-marked subterritory of an established male. If there is insufficient space within the colony's total territory to allow for each assertive male to have breeding space, someone has to leave. Assertive males that cannot successfully challenge the dominant breeding male will be driven from the group and will seek to establish their own new groups.Understanding these natural group relationships and interactions, and the possibilities for disruption of those dynamics, has great importance for understanding the behavior of pet cats, especially when they are kept in groups indoors.Living with a PredatorThe lesson in taking time to understand the cat's natural physiology and lifestyle is that altering that lifestyle will result in disease and behavioral disability. For all of their advanced intelligence, house cats cannot adjust to highly unnatural living circumstances any better than their much larger wild cousins on the African savannahs or the rain forests of Asia could. <i>The domestic cat is not domestic.</i> It is a small, essentially feral species that has made only modest accommodations to living intimately with humans.I find the attraction some people feel for keeping wild species of felines as pets ironic. The seemingly less-exotic domestic cat is as wild in its mind, heart, and soul as the grand, fierce, big cats could ever be. Today, knowledgeable animal lovers understand that keeping a big cat requires great attention to such a cat's urgent needs for the right food, the right environment, and the right handling. We assume, however, that our house cats are so much different in their requirements for health and well-being. This is a mistaken belief.True, our familiar house cat is not, generally speaking, a dangerous creature capable of killing or injuring us the way big cats are. Its size and deceptive amiability makes it a delightful and easy-to-keep pet. The differences between house cats and the lions, tigers, leopards, and innumerable other wild felines of movies and wildlife documentaries stop there, however. The predator that greets us at the door at the end of a busy workday, that shares our bed on a cold rainy night, and that slumbers in utter contentment on the top of our computer as we work in our office is an ancient, instinctive, hunting machine. I believe that the dreams of our beloved feline pets are filled with the thrill of the chase after prey, the comfort of napping in the incandescent equatorial sun, and the smell of monsoon rains beating relentlessly down on the towering shelt...</p><h2>Let There Be Reign</h2><p>Johnny Hart (1931-2007) was born and raised in Endicott, New York.

The euphoria of the first days of the Liberation, the slow awakening of the inmates to the possibilities of love and normalcy, the beauty of the spring landscape in which the lovers walk hand-in-hand make the atrocities that preceded them seem inconceivable.

Until the publication of the <i>Zohar</i>, the <i>Bahir</i> was the most influential and widely quoted primary source of Kabbalistic teachings.<br>The <i>Bahir</i> is quoted in every major book on Kabbalah, the earliest being the Raavad's commentary on Sefer Yetzirah, and it is cited numerous times by Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban) in his commentary on the Torah. It is also quoted many times in the <i>Zohar</i>. It was first published around 1176 by the Provence school of Kabbalists; the first printed edition appeared in Amsterdam in 1651.<br>The name <i>Bahir</i> is derived from the first verse quoted in the text (Job 37:21), "And now they do not see light, it is brilliant (Bahir) in the skies." It is also called the "Midrash of Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana," particularly by the Ramban. The reason might be that Rabbi Nehuniah's name is at the very beginning of the book, but most Kabbalists actually attribute the <i>Bahir</i> to him and his school. Some consider it the oldest kabbalistic text ever written.<br>Although the <i>Bahir</i> is a fairly small book, some 12,000 words in all, it was very highly esteemed among those who probed its mysteries. Rabbi Judah Chayit, a prominent fifteenth-century Kabbalist, writes, "Make this book a crown for your head." Much of the text is very difficult to understand, and Rabbi Moshe Cordevero (1522-1570), head of the Safed school of Kabbalah, says, "The words of this text are bright (Bahir) and sparkling, but their brilliance can blind the eye."<br>One of the most important concepts revealed in the <i>Bahir</i> is that of the Ten Sefirot, and careful analysis of these discussions yields much of what will be found in later kabbalistic works, as well as their relation to anthropomorphism and the reason for the commandments.

They drove a moderately priced sedan chosen, Karl said, for its gas efficiency and for its high rating in <i>Consumer Reports.</i> </p><p> "Karl makes the decisions about everything we buy," Thelma explained with a light laugh that punctuated most of what she said. "He says an informed consumer is a protected consumer. You can't believe in advertisements. Advertisements, especially commercials, are just full of a lot of misinformation, right, Karl?" </p><p> "Yes, dear," Karl agreed. </p><p> I sat in the rear, and Thelma remained turned on an angle so she could talk to me all the way to their home -- my new home -- in Wappingers Falls, New York. </p><p> "Karl and I were childhood sweethearts. Did I tell you that?" </p><p> She continued before I could tell her she had. </p><p> "We started to go together in the tenth grade, and when Karl went to college, I remained faithful to him, and he remained faithful to me. After he graduated and was appointed to his position at IBM, we planned our wedding. Karl helped my parents make all the arrangements, right down to the best place to go for flowers, right, Karl?" </p><p> "That's true," he said, nodding. He didn't take his eyes off the road. </p><p> "Ordinarily, Karl doesn't like to have long conversations in the car when he's driving," Thelma explained, gazing at him and smiling. "He says people forget how driving a car is something that requires their full attention." </p><p> "Especially nowadays," Karl elaborated, "with so many more cars on the road, so many more teenage drivers and older drivers. Those two age groups account for more than sixty percent of all accidents." </p><p> "Karl has all sorts of statistics like that floating around his mind," Thelma said proudly. "Just last week, I was thinking about replacing our gas stove with a new electric range, and Karl converted BTUs...is that it, Karl? BTUs?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "BTUs into pennies of cost and showed me how the gas stove was more efficient. Isn't it wonderful to have a husband like Karl who can keep you from making the wrong decisions?" </p><p> I smiled and gazed out the windows. The orphanage wasn't much more than fifty or so miles from where my new parents lived, but I had never traveled this far north. Other than some school field trips, I hadn't been to many places at all. Just leaving the orphanage and going twenty miles by car was an adventure. </p><p> It was late summer, and the cooler autumn winds had already begun to descend from the north. Leaves were turning rust and orange, and when I could see far into the distance and look over the heavily wooded mountains, I thought the ripple of colors was breathtakingly beautiful. This was a bright, sunny day, too. The sky was a deep, rich blue, and the clouds that flowed across it in a stream of wind stretched themselves until they became as thin as gauze. Way off to the south, an airplane turned into a silver dot and then disappeared into the clouds. </p><p> I was happy and full of hope. I would have a home, a place to call my own, and someone else to care about besides myself, as well as, I hoped, someone to care about me. How simple that was and how taken for granted by most people, but how wonderful and new and precious it was for orphans like myself. </p><p> "Karl is the oldest of three brothers and the only one married. His middle brother, Stuart, is a salesman for an air-conditioner manufacturer in Albany, and his younger rother, Gary, has graduated from a culinary institute in Poughkeepsie, where Karl's father lives. Gary was hired to cook on a cruise ship, so we don't hear from him or see him much at all. </p><p> "Karl and his brothers are not far apart in age, but they're not all that close. No one is in Karl's family, right, Karl?" </p><p> Karl nearly turned to look at her. His head started to move and then stopped when an automobile about fifty yards in front of us emerged from a driveway and he had to slow down. </p><p> "If they didn't speak to each other on the phone occasionally, they wouldn't know who still existed in the family and who didn't. Karl's father is still alive, but his mother passed away, what, two years ago, Karl?" </p><p> "A year and eleven months tomorrow," Karl said mechanically. </p><p> "A year and eleven months," she repeated like a translator. </p><p> So I have two uncles and a grandfather on Karl's side, I thought. Before I could ask about her side, she volunteered the information. </p><p> "I don't have any brothers or sisters," Thelma said. "My mother wasn't supposed to have any children. She had breast cancer when she was only seventeen, and the doctors advised her not to have children. Then, late in life, when she was in her early thirties, she became pregnant with me. My father was forty-one at the time. Now my mother is fifty-eight and my father is sixty-nine. </p><p> "I bet you're wondering why we don't have any children of our own. Before you, I mean," she added quickly. </p><p> "It's none of my business," I said. </p><p> "Oh, sure it is. Everything that's our business is your business now. We're going to be a family, so we have to share and be honest with each other, right, Karl?" </p><p> "Absolutely," he said, signaling to change lanes and pass the car ahead of us. </p><p> "Karl's sperm count is too low," she said with a smile, as if she were delighted about it. </p><p> "I don't know if we should talk about that, Thelma." The back of Karl's neck turned pink with embarrassment. </p><p> "Oh, of course we can. She's old enough and probably knows everything there is to know. Kids today are very advanced. How can they not help it, with all that's on television? Do you watch television much, Crystal?" </p><p> "No," I answered. </p><p> "Oh," she said, the excitement fading in her face for the first time since we had met. Her eyes looked like tiny flashlights with weakened batteries. Then she thought of something and smiled again. "Well, that's probably because you didn't have much opportunity in a home with so many other children. Anyway, we did try to have children. As soon as Karl determined it was financially sensible for us, we tried, right, Karl?" </p><p> He nodded. </p><p> "Nothing happened no matter how we planned it. I used a thermometer to take my temperature, plotted the days on my calendar, even planned some romantic evenings," she said, blushing. She shrugged. "Nothing happened. We just thought we were missing," she continued. "Take better aim, I used to tell him, didn't I, Karl?" </p><p> "Thelma, you're embarrassing me," he said. </p><p> "Oh, fiddledy-doo. We're a family. We can't be embarrassed," she emphasized. </p><p> The simplicity and honesty with which she talked about the most intimate details of her life fascinated me. </p><p> "Anyway," she continued, turning back to me, "Karl read up on it and learned that he should keep his scrotum cool. He avoided wearing anything tight, refrained from taking hot baths, and tried to keep himself cool, especially before we were going to make a baby. We even waited longer between times because periods of sexual restraint usually increase the volume and potency of sperm, right, Karl?" </p><p> "You don't have to get into the nitty-gritty details, Thelma." </p><p> "Oh, sure I do. I want Crystal to understand. I was reading a magazine the other day, <i>Modern Parent</i> or something like that, and the article said mothers and daughters especially should be honest and open about everything so they can build trust. </p><p> "Where was I?" she asked. "Oh, volume and potency of sperm. So, when that didn't work, we went to a doctor. You know that the average male produces anywhere from 120 million to 600 million sperm in a single ejaculation?" </p><p> "You have trouble with so many other facts and statistics, Thelma. How come you don't forget that one?" Karl asked gently. </p><p> "I don't know. It's not easy to forget, I guess," she said, shrugging. "Anyway, we found out that Karl was way below that and it didn't ma</p></p><h2>AND THE MOUTAINS ECHOED* (141 POCHE)</h2><p>And the Mountains Echoed</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013:</strong> Khaled Hosseini&#x2019;s <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em> begins simply enough, with a father recounting a folktale to his two young children. The tale is about a young boy who is taken by a <em>div</em> (a sort of ogre), and how that fate might not be as terrible as it first seems&#x2014;a brilliant device that firmly sets the tone for the rest of this sweeping, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting novel. A day after he tells the tale of the <em>div</em>, the father gives away his own daughter to a wealthy man in Kabul. What follows is a series of stories within the story, told through multiple viewpoints, spanning more than half a century, and shifting across continents. The novel moves through war, separation, birth, death, deceit, and love, illustrating again and again how people&#x2019;s actions, even the seemingly selfless ones, are shrouded in ambiguity. This is a masterwork by a master storyteller. &#x2014;<em>Chris Schluep</em>With more than ten million copies sold in the United States of &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns,&#34; and more than thirty-eight million copies sold worldwide in more than seventy countries, Khaled Hosseini is one of most widely read and beloved novelists in the entire world. &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; spent 103 weeks on the &#34;New York Times&#34; bestseller list, and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; debuted as a #1 &#34;New York Times&#34; bestseller, remaining in the #1 spot for fifteen weeks, and spending nearly an entire year on the bestseller list.

This edition contains the original illustrations by E. H.

Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures.

These regiments were called, naturally enough, infanterie francaise as opposed to the mercenary 'foreign' infantry recruited elsewhere. Making up the bulk of the army, all officers and men were to be of the Roman Catholic faith, the official state religion. Regimental recruiting parties went to towns and villages looking for likely young volunteers, inducing them to enlist with the usual promises &#x2013; quick money, fast women, good wines and great glory.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Ren� Chartrand was born in Montreal and educated in Canada, the United States and the Bahamas.

But Lauren Kessler wants something more than to follow the cosmetic path to youthfulness. She wants to live with energy, stamina, vitality, resilience, and health for a very, very long time. Her goal: to reverse her biological age from the inside out.<br><br>Guided by both intense curiosity and healthy skepticism, a sense of adventure and a sense of humor, Kessler sets out to discover just what's required to prolong those healthy, vital, and productive years called the "health span." In her yearlong journey, Kessler investigates and fully immerses herself in the hope and hype of the anti-aging movement. She delves into the new science of "biomarkers"&#x2014;objective, measurable indications of how old you really are on the inside&#x2014;going as far as getting a muscle biopsy to determine the state of her mitochondria, the parts of cells that control metabolism. She tries Tabata training, calorie restriction, a diet centered on 20 superfoods, hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), hypnosis to achieve a youthful mindset, and much more. In a voice that speaks to every woman who feels her date of birth and sense of self have little in common, Kessler explores her own fears, attitudes, and assumptions about aging. <i>Counterclockwise</i> is a thoughtful, hilarious, and informative tale of what's really possible when you get serious about taking charge of how well and how quickly you age.</p><p>Lauren Kessler is the author of <i>My Teenage Werewolf: A Mother, a Daughter, a Journey Through the Thicket of Adolescence</i>; award-winning <i>Dancing with Rose</i>; <i>Washington Post </i>bestseller <i>Clever Girl</i>; and <i>Los Angeles Times </i>bestseller <i>The Happy Bottom Riding Club</i>.

There is no bay. And Mandalay (a city in Upper Burma) is a good 8,000 miles away. Much closer--next door, in fact--is the 30-story Luxor pyramid (a mere 100 feet shorter than the Great Pyramid of Giza), and just down the street is a two- thirds-scale Arc de Triomphe.<br><br>You have guessed that I am in Las Vegas.<br><br>I am here for the 18th Annual International Congress on Anti-Aging Medicine and Regenerative Biomedical Technologies. I mention the locale, this ersatz landscape, this topography of illusion and pretend, because it is more than venue. It is theme and subtext. Vegas is both a working city and a fantasy playground, a place for dreamers and risk takers run by eagle-eyed entrepreneurs and hardheaded businessmen. Which is, in many ways, how I come to think of this conference during my three days in attendance: an almost seamless blend of fantasy and reality, of science and hucksterism, of life-changing research and unadulterated opportunism.<br><br>The twice-yearly conference (the other venue is, predictably, Orlando, home of that other commercial fantasy-scape, Disney World) is sponsored by, and the public face of, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, known as A4M. It is an interesting--and controversial--organization, an upstart in the world of mainstream medicine, a group that, like the specialty it represents, has attracted both true believers and harsh critics. A nonprofit organization that trains and certifies physicians in anti-aging medicine, it began with 30 like-minded doctors in the early 1990s and has grown to include more than 22,000 members in 100-plus countries. A4M's conventions got off to an unconventional start in 1993, when a small group of physicians gathered for the opening of an anti-aging clinic in Mexico. The founder of the clinic, a 59-year-old businessman, was an early adopter of and proselytizer for the use of human growth hormone. He'd been flying down to Mexico to get injections and, after reporting miraculous anti-aging results, decided to start a clinic of his own.<br><br>Today, although A4M "board certifies" physicians in anti-aging medicine, the specialty itself is not recognized by established medical organizations like the American Medical Association and the American Board of Medical Specialties. Some physicians, intrigued by functional or regenerative medicine (the other terms used for the anti-aging approach), have embraced the new specialty. Others call it a "sham" and a "racket" because of both its powerful entrepreneurial bent--the clinics and therapies and treatments and supplements that can directly enrich a specialist's practice--and the less-than-gold-standard science that supports it. Much (not all, but much) of the science behind commercial anti-aging therapies does not come from large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind human studies. Although that approach is not without its critics, its carefully constructed scientific investigations are designed to be as objective as possible, removing the chance for the investigators themselves to influence the outcome, controlling for factors that might affect the results, and including a (human) test group large enough to generalize from. Studies like this are phenomenally expensive. They are undertaken with an eye toward FDA approval of a drug or treatment and the subsequent bonanza that approval can mean for a drug company. But many anti-aging treatments are supplement based. Supplements are classified as food, not drugs, so FDA approval is not needed, and that means large-scale human studies are not required--and, because of their prohibitive cost, not undertaken. Thus reports on the successes of various therapies come from small studies, animal studies, and that bane of every scientist's existence, anecdotal evidence.<br><br>The organization doesn't do itself any favors with its stance of aggressive self-promotion. And it probably doesn't help the cause of mainstream acceptance that the founders of A4M, Ronald Klatz, MD, and Robert Goldman, MD, are not shy. And by "not shy" I mean: They are showmen. Klatz, credited with coining the term "anti-aging" and hailed by BusinessWeek as its "guru," is the author of 32 books with, as his Web site will tell you, "over 2 million copies in print." He was an early and enthusiastic proponent of using human growth hormone to purportedly reverse aging, and his Grow Young with HGH was a national bestseller in the late 1990s. He is an enthusiastic producer of podcasts and a tireless self-marketer.<br><br>Klatz's A4M partner and friend, Robert Goldman, calls himself "anti-aging's global ambassador." And he is. The man travels the world, consulting and teaching at universities from Central America to South Asia. He sits on boards, creates companies, gets handed keys to Italian cities, and actively- -and I do mean actively--promotes physical fitness. He holds 20 world strength records, including one for 13,500 consecutive situps and another for 321 consecutive handstand pushups. You will find him in Guinness World Records. You will also find him at this A4M convention, waiting in the wings as his colleague, Dr. Klatz, opens the show.<br><br>The convention center's main ballroom is so cavernous that, even though I am sitting only a third of the way back from the stage, I can hardly make out Klatz's face. Happily, there is a movie-theater-size screen on each side of the dais that projects the image to me and the 5,000 or so other people from 60 countries who have gathered here to learn the latest about anti-aging research from more than 100 presenters.<br><br>Klatz, 10 feet tall on screen, is not, alas, the best advertisement for his specialty. He is thick-necked, a little portly, and a little out of breath, all of which I find oddly comforting. His message this morning is upbeat and inspirational--in both medical and commercial terms. He is a coach speaking to his players, players who love and believe in the game. And want to win.<br><br>"Anti-aging medicine is transforming the practice of medicine and transforming the world," he tells us. "It is a new intelligence for the entire planet." Klatz says that anti-aging medicine is the world's fastest- growing medical specialty, the "hottest trend" in health care. In case there's any doubt as to what this means to the audience gathered in the convention hall, he ends his welcome with this statistic: By the year 2015, revenue in the global anti-aging market will exceed $200 billion.<br><br>Dr. Goldman is next up. I was hoping he would do a few handstand pushups, but instead he delivers a brief, passionate message about wellness that positions anti-aging medicine at the forefront of best practices. "It is about health, not illness," he says. "Conventional medicine waits until something breaks to fix it. Anti-aging medicine intervenes before that happens. It is about prevention." I find the message powerful and convincing. The two doctors, in less than five minutes, have managed to get me on their team. And they're just getting warmed up.<br><br>Third at bat, and apparently a regular at these conventions, is Ken Dychtwald, PhD, a psychologist, gerontologist, author of 15 books, filmmaker, and, as he later tells us, "old hippie" and friend of spiritual figure Ram Dass. He is 60 with a full head of curly hair, the posture and stance of a 30-year-old, and the energy and excitement of a revivalist preacher. He says that 65 was selected as the marker of old age back in the mid-1800s. Up on the screen flashes a slide of the iconic painting Whistler's Mother, painted when she was 65. Her back is curved. She's got jowls and a turkey neck. Then he clicks the remote in his hand and next to Whistler's Mother there appears a photo of Sophia Loren at 65. Let me just say that Whistler's mother suffers somewhat by comparison. The audience laughs, then claps.<br><br>He clicks through a slide show featuring active, adventurous, tech-savvy, vibrant older people. He shows a picture of John Glenn suited up for his final space journey at age 77. Glenn looks clear-eyed and resolute, strong and vital, ready for the challenge. "People want to be healthy so they can continue to dream and create and do meaningful things," he says. I can't help myself: I clap.<br><br>Dychtwald says he wants to do away with the term "retirement." Me too. I think of stewed prunes and All-Bran for breakfast, fishing trips, knitting projects, those special recliners with the lever that tips the seat forward so you can get your aging ass out of the chair. As Dychtwald talks, I look up "retirement" on my smartphone. "The act of retreating," says the entry. "The act of withdrawing into seclusion." That's not what I have in mind for the latter part of my life. Whatever else happens at this convention, I tell myself, I will keep Ken Dychtwald's message in mind. Staying youthful, vital, and healthy can have a purpose.<br><br>Before the opening speeches this morning, I spent a solid hour studying the convention booklet with the goal of plotting my own schedule for the next two and a half days. The booklet, a hefty, magazine-size publication larded with advertising, lists every paper presentation, speech, and seminar, from the marquee presenters who will address thousands in the ballroom to the unknowns assigned to one of the dozens of small seminar rooms. With four or five presentations scheduled for every hour, it's a challenge to figure out a plan. I want to see what doctors and researchers in this yet-to-be- recognized specialty of anti-aging think is most important, where they are pinning their hopes, what they see on the horizon. If anti-aging is, as Klatz says, the "hottest new trend," I want to know what the hottest new trend is within the hottest new trend.<br><br>Once upon a time, in the mid-1700s, the biggest thing in anti-aging involved placing five virgins in a small airtight room, piercing a hole through the wall of the chamber, and inserting the long neck of a flask used for distilling. The warm breath of the young girls would flow into the flask and condense into a "clear water, which is a tincture of admirable efficacy," a few drops of which could make the old young again. Dr. Johann Cohausen, whose theory this was, was only half kidding. Both a physician and a medical satirist (did you know that was a job category?), he lived to be 105.<br><br>Alas, I'm not expecting any presentations on virgin's breath today. I head out to my first session, the focus of which is inflammation--not the puffy- sprained-ankle kind of inflammation but internal inflammation, along the walls of arteries, in the brain, the kind that leads to cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's, the kind that ages you from the inside out. This researcher, a fast-talker with a PowerPoint slide show only a biochemist could love, says that 90 percent of all chronic disease has an inflammation component--and that half of us suffer from at least one of those diseases. Chronic illness is both a marker for and an accelerator of aging.<br><br>Now she launches into the villains in this story: the unhealthy lifestyles of so many of us. She cites research suggesting a direct link between food-- particularly sugary foods and foods rich in omega-6 fatty acids, like cottonseed oil and tub margarine. Her slides, with lipoprotein, CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha flowcharts, are simultaneously incomprehensible and utterly convincing. She talks about chronic stress and the stress hormone cortisol, about the evils of cigarettes and obesity, known for doing so much other damage to the body and now also indicted in the body's inflammatory response. She's not thrilled about EMFs and cell phones. I scribble notes about taking CoQ10, vitamin D, and bioflavonoid supplements, which she says are powerful antiinflammatories, and wonder if I should get my cortisol level checked . . . especially right now, as I try to process all this information, copy down as many citations as I can, eavesdrop on a heated, albeit whispered, conversation behind me (the cell phone controversy), and check my schedule for the next session. I wonder: Can attending an anti- aging conference age you?<br><br>I'm off to Hyaluronic Acid: The Anti-Aging Answer for the Whole Body. I've never heard of hyaluronic acid, and my knowledge is not greatly enhanced by learning, in the presenter's introduction, that hyaluronic acid is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. Whatever it is, we used to have a lot more of it when we were younger. Its presence accounted for our soft skin, vibrant circulatory system, healthy connective tissue, and limber joints. It appears to be a lubricant and repairer of tissues, the sort of molecule you want on your side. I'm not keeping up with the steady stream of slides, but I am understanding the basic idea: The plum-to-prune or grape-to-raisin phenomenon that is an unhappy external hallmark of aging occurs not only at the skin level, but also throughout the body. And it occurs, at least in part--this guy says in large part--because of decreasing levels of hyaluronic acid. The stuff is integral to our 50 to 100 trillion cells, our 60,000 miles of blood vessels (stats courtesy of one of the few slides I could actually comprehend), our ocular and oral health, our everything. As levels decrease as we age, we prune up from the inside.<br><br>I learn that medical use of hyaluronic acid has been around since the 1970s. It's been used in various eye surgeries, in the treatment of osteoarthritis, to help alleviate eczema, and, since 2003, as a wrinkle- plumping injectable. (Restylane and Juvederm are the brands you might recognize.) But this presentation is not about topical applications or injectable substances. It is about biochemically altering the body, which is really what much of this pioneering anti-aging research is about. In this case, it is about giving the body the hyaluronic acid it no longer makes or helping it make more so that we can be, inside and out, more plum than prune. It's one of those "this is the key to anti-aging" ideas--and there are many being forwarded at this conference--that sound too good to be true.<br><br>One of the overlooked benefits of aging is that your too-good-to-be-true antennae become increasingly sensitive to too-good-to-be-true ideas. My first thought is: Isn't the body far, far more complicated than this? It can't be that you tweak one chemical and fix everything. My next thought is that tagline from a long-ago margarine commercial: It's not nice to fool Mother Nature. That night, doing follow-up research back in my hotel room, it doesn't take me long to discover that hyaluronic acid, for all its wonderful actions in the body, is also an integral part of cancer metastases and angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels to nourish a tumor). So if I trick my body into producing more hyaluronic acid in an effort to stay plum- and grape-like, could I also be setting the stage for big problems? This is when one of those nonexistent large-scale, double- blind, placebo-controlled studies would come in handy.</p><h2>Basketball Legends Alphabet</h2><p><strong>The ultimate basketball alphabet</strong>&nbsp;&#x1f3c0; <p>From Michael Jordan to 'Magic' Johnson, LeBron James to Shaquille O'Neal, Basketball Legends Alphabet is a slam dunk A to Z of All-Star ballers that have earned their place in history.

Her favorite technique?one she permits herself only as a special treat?plays out at the Grand Hotel, where with luck she can usually charm a lonely visiting businessman into buying her dinner and a room for the night. But then she picks the wrong businessman. When his dead body is found the next morning, Sybilla becomes the prime suspect. For years, her anonymity has sheltered her; she has found a kind of home in the invisibility of homeless life. But with her anonymity shattered, Sybilla is forced into the one course of action that might allow her to go home again.</p><p>KARIN ALVTEGEN is the most exciting new crime writer in Scandinavia. Missing was awarded the premier Scandinavian crime writing award and was also nominated for the Poloni Award and Best Crime Novel in Sweden.*Starred Review* Sybilla may have been born to wealthy parents, but her home life was never easy, and she ran away at 17. Ever since, Sybilla has been homeless and living off the grid. Her peaceful existence comes to a sudden end when she is accused of murder and goes on the run, too scared to go to the police and clear herself but frantic to regain her carefully built life. Both a mystery (Who is really doing the murders?) and a psychological study (Why did Sybilla run from her family?), Missing heralds the arrival in the U.S. of another outstanding Scandinavian crime writer. Winner of the Glass Key Award in Sweden, this is a taut, riveting, and impossible-to-put-down story of a young woman caught up in a bad situation.

It was after a period in Saudi Arabia, which she found &#x2018;damaging physically and spiritually&#x2019; that Donna decided to move to Venice, where she has now lived for over twenty years.</p> <p>Her debut as a crime fiction writer began as a joke: talking in a dressing room in Venice&#x2019;s opera-house La Fenice after a performance, Donna and a singer friend were vilifying a particular German conductor. From the thought &#x2018;why don&#x2019;t we kill him?&#x2019; and discussion of when, where and how, the idea for <b>Death at La Fenice</b> took shape, and was completed over the next four months.</p> <p><b> Donna Leon is the crime reviewer for the London <b>Sunday Times</b>&nbsp;and is an opera expert. She has written the libretto for a comic opera, entitled <b>Dona Gallina</b>. Set in a chicken coop, and making use of existing baroque music, <b>Donna Gallina</b> was premiered in Innsbruck. Brigitte Fassbaender, one of the great mezzo-sopranos of our time, and now head of the Landestheater in Innsbruck, agreed to come out of retirement both to direct the opera and to play the part of the witch Azuneris (whose name combines the names of the two great Verdi villainesses Azucena and Amneris).</b></p>To solve the murder of a young American soldier, commissario of Venice police Guido Brunetti encounters investigational constraints that leave him awed and embittered. Anna Fields&#39;s narration resonates with the emotional upheavals Brunetti feels as he conforms to police procedures that leave him stonewalled. Fields cautiously portrays the cast of characters, differentiating each one uniquely. We sense the sinister and innocent via her mediated expression, and appreciate the difficult case Guido Brunetti has undertaken. B.J.L.

Flake won the Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe New Talent Award for her first novel <i>The Skin I'm In</i> and is a two-time Coretta Scott King Author Honor Book winner. Belived by children and adults, critics and booksellers, librarians and teachers, she is the author of six books for yourng adults that have sold more than half a million copies. The mother of a college-age daughter, Flake writes full time from her home in Pitsburgh.Grade 6-8-Seventh-grader Maleeka Madison is miserable when a new teacher comes to her depressed inner-city school. Miss Saunders evidently is rich, self-assured in spite of the white birthmark across her black skin, and prone to getting into kids' faces about both their behavior and their academic potential. Black and bright, Maleeka is so swamped by her immediate problems that Miss Saunders's attentions nearly capsize her stability. The girl's mother has just emerged from a two-year period of intense mourning for her dead husband, during which time her daughter has provided her with physical and moral support with no adult assistance. At school, Maleeka endures mean-spirited teasing about the darkness of her skin and her unstylish clothing. She seeks solace in writing an extended creative piece, at Miss Saunders's instigation, and also in the company of a powerful clique of nasty girls. Told in Maleeka's voice, this first novel bristles with attitude that is both genuine and alarming. The young teen understands too well that her brains aren't as valuable as the social standing that she doesn't have. In the end, she is able to respond positively to Miss Saunders; she also becomes socially anointed through the affections of the most popular boy in the school. This message rings true in spite of the fact that Maleeka's salvation isn't exactly politically correct. Young teens will appreciate Flake's authenticity and perhaps realize how to learn from Maleeka's struggle for security and self-assurance.<br><i>Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How I Lived a Year on Just a Pound a Day</h2><p>Incredible but true - the story of how one woman lived for a whole year on just a pound a day.

C. to Apocalypse Now</h2><p>In this extensively illustrated study of Hollywood&#39;s extravagant relationship with history, the author analyzes historic film moments alongside historical facts</p><p>Where history is concerned, Hollywood has often altered facts to suit filmmaking purposes, but filmmakers have sometimes been faithful to history as well. Examining seven admittedly idiosyncratic "ages," the author here juxtaposes what "actually happened" with illustrated examples of the Hollywood treatment. Looking at the Ancient World, he examines One Million Years BC , The Ten Commandments , Cleopatra and Quo Vadis , among others. For the chapter titled "Knights and Barbarians" he extols The Vikings , which "ought to be shown regularly to schoolchildren as a fine image of the distant past" and in "Tudors and Sea Dogs" praises Captain Blood for its truthful attention to the ethics of buccaneering. In "Romance and Royalty" Fraser laments the fact that Charles II, who led a perfectly filmic life, has never been adequately treated on celluloid. In the chapter on the British Empire he pays a backhanded compliment to Charge of the Light Brigade : "the script, holding nothing sacred, has plundered Indian Mutiny history at one pointand got it right." The Pilgrims, the Civil War, the old West, the roaring '20s, WW I and II and Vietnam are also examined in this arbitrary and opinionated, irreverent and immensely enjoyable study. Fraser is also the author of the Flashman series of (accurate) historical novels. Photos. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Writing in a witty and entertaining style, the authora novelist and screenwriterhere assumes the role of apologist for the historical film. He believes that this film genre has been unfairly maligned, and contends that ". . . nothing has been more influential in shaping our visions of the past than the commercial cinema." Fraser divides history into seven ages and compares films with the actual events upon which they are based, discussing the merits as well as the weaknesses of these films. Enhanced by numerous photos and laced with historical facts, movie trivia, and personal insights into filmmaking, this is lively and interesting.

Table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) -- the primary sources of fructose -- are staples of our food supply, and are even found in foods that aren't necessarily sweet, like breads, soups, ketchup, and salad dressing.

Previously chief of nephrology and director of renal transplantation at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Dr. Johnson is now chief of nephrology, hypertension, and transplantation at the University of Florida in Gainesville.CHAPTER 1<br><br>THE FRUCTOSE FACTOR<br><br>A Sugar Like No Other<br><br>A century ago, few Americans were overweight. Heart disease and diabetes were rare medical conditions. Today, people who are plump and paunchy outnumber those who are thin and fit in the United States and many other parts of the world. Heart attacks are the leading cause of death. The incidence of diabetes has exploded into a full-blown epidemic.<br><br>What happened? How could such dramatic changes to overall health occur during this relatively brief period in human history? I believe the rise of obesity and these formerly rare diseases can largely be traced to a single factor. Unlike a disease-carrying microbe, however, this culprit is hiding in plain sight--on the shelves at your local supermarket, in the cooler at the convenience store, and very likely in your refrigerator and kitchen cupboard.<br><br>The goal of this book is to help you understand, identify, and avoid this menace. What's more, I am going to show you how to reverse the damage it may have already caused in your system.<br><br>You don't need to be a doctor or scientist to see the most obvious signs of this scourge's handiwork. Simply walk through a shopping mall or playground- -that is, if you haven't already noticed the problem in your bathroom mirror. In other words, consider how the American physique has changed over the years.<br><br>In the 19th century, few people in this country worried about their waistlines. It's not that our ancestors didn't care about their weight. The fact is, fat people were extremely rare, typically found among the upper class. After all, only the wealthy could afford to overindulge in rich, decadent foods back then. In 1890, for example, a survey of more than 5,000 white males in their fifties found that just 3.4 percent were obese.<br><br>However, that once-lean population has gone the way of hoop dresses and top hats. Today, 32 percent of Americans are obese. What's more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an additional one-third of Americans are overweight, meaning they are not quite obese but still have an unhealthy amount of body fat. When you do the math, it adds up to an alarming problem: Two-thirds of Americans are either obese or overweight. However, unlike in the 19th century, weight problems afflict all segments of the population--rich and poor, young and old, every race and educational background. The nation's schoolyards may offer the most disturbing view of this epidemic: One in three children in the United States is overweight or obese.<br><br>Doctors and public health authorities are alarmed by the nation's growing girth for good reason. Carrying around excess weight increases the risk for deadly conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease. What's more, being fat in a culture that idolizes slender and beautiful celebrities can be psychologically crippling. But what's most worrisome, and most puzzling, is why obesity rates are rising so rapidly. On the eve of the American bicentennial--in 1975, when the nation had been in existence for nearly 200 years--the obesity rate in the United States reached 15 percent. Since then, in a period of just 30 years, the obesity rate more than doubled.<br><br>Why? What has caused America to become so flabby so fast?<br><br>Frustrated dieters often blame their genes. Perhaps you have tried to lose weight in the past, but you couldn't shed those extra �ds. Or maybe you managed to trim down, but the weight eventually returned. If so, in the back of your mind, you may have been tempted to blame your parents. After all, if you have your mother's eyes or your father's smile, doesn't it make sense that you got your chunky thighs or bulging belly from them, too?<br><br>In fact, scientists have isolated genes that may be linked to obesity. But we merely inherit a tendency for one body shape or another from our parents. Whether or not you become overweight and obese depends largely on the lifestyle choices you make--that is, what foods you eat and how much exercise you get. Further, when you consider the bigger picture, it's hard to imagine how genetics could possibly be blamed for the current rapid rise in obesity. After all, the human genetic code dates back millennia. Has some mutation in the human genome occurred across the US population during the past 3 or 4 decades that is causing widespread uncontrollable weight gain? That's highly unlikely. In fact, such a genetic alteration would have to be occurring in populations all over the world, because obesity rates are rising in countries across the globe.<br><br>Instead, something must have changed in our environment that is exploiting the human tendency to accumulate body fat. A couple of obvious candidates come to mind. For instance, you no longer need to be wealthy to eat a waist- expanding diet. Thanks to advances in farming, manufacturing, and shipping, delicious high-calorie foods are cheap and widely available. Meanwhile, Americans burn fewer calories each day than our ancestors did, due to the rise of laborsaving devices, from the lawn mower to the laptop computer.<br><br>But while there is no doubt that Americans eat too much and don't exercise enough, I believe that some other mechanism has contributed to the disturbing and unprecedented weight gain that has swept across the United States in recent years. Reams of data that have emerged from research labs over the past decade indict a specific food: a common form of sugar called fructose that most of us eat every day.<br><br>Americans consume 30 percent more fructose today than in 1970. Our rising consumption of this sugar began at roughly the same time that obesity rates in the United States were climbing sharply. In the pages that follow, I will explain why I believe these corresponding trends are intimately linked- -why feeding on so much fructose is fueling a public health catastrophe in the United States, and how you can lose weight and safeguard your overall health by limiting your exposure to this dangerous sweetener.<br><br>The Fructose Connection<br><br>Fructose has always been part of the human diet, since the first hungry forager plucked an apple from a tree or berries from a bush. That's because fructose, as the name suggests, is the main form of sugar found in fruit. Honey is another abundant natural source. What's more, half of every crystal of refined sugar consists of fructose, too.<br><br>If you have read much about fructose lately, that's probably because it is the critical component in a controversial sweetener called high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is used in a wide variety of processed foods and beverages. Most brands of soda and many kinds of candy contain HFCS. If you were to start reading product labels, you'd find that HFCS is also in many foods that might surprise you, such as pasta sauce, yogurt, soups, ketchup and other condiments, and sandwich bread. In 1970, the average American consumed less than 1/2 �d of HFCS per year. By 2000, per capita consumption of the corn-based sweetener had risen to more than 42 �ds per year.<br><br>Critics call HFCS "Frankensyrup" and other damning names, blaming it for the current outbreak of obesity, especially among children in the United States. In later chapters, I'll examine HFCS more closely and sort out some of the claims its defenders and detractors have made. For now, though, here's the important point: There is mounting scientific evidence that consuming too much fructose, no matter where it comes from, can make you fat and increase your risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease.<br><br>Fructose and Your Waistline<br><br>In the past generation, scientists from all over the world have begun to closely examine fructose and its effects on human health. My colleagues and I at the University of Florida are actively involved in this research. We have made a number of discoveries about changes that occur in the body from consuming fructose and certain other foods and how they can cause weight gain and health problems. Our work, along with investigations conducted by other scientists, strongly suggests that America's fondness for fructose- rich foods is fueling the obesity epidemic. I will discuss these findings in greater detail throughout this book, but here is a snapshot of what we have learned so far.<br><br>Eating a high-fructose diet causes rapid weight gain. Eating too much of any form of sugar will make you fat. However, recent studies--performed in my laboratory, as well as by other scientists--have found that animals gain weight very quickly and develop other unhealthy symptoms when they eat too much fructose. Yet the same thing does not occur when animals are fed equal amounts of other sugars. In other words, eating fructose appears to cause greater weight gain than other forms of sugar, even if the same number of calories is consumed.<br><br>High-fructose foods do not satisfy your appetite. When you eat most types of sugar, your body responds by producing appetite hormones, which signal your brain that your body has consumed enough food to meet its energy needs. As this occurs, feelings of hunger subside. But unlike other sugars, fructose escapes the attention of appetite hormones. Because of this phenomenon, your brain never gets the message that your body has consumed a load of calories. As a result, the appetite center in your brain remains unsatisfied, so you continue eating. In one study, subjects felt hungrier after drinking beverages sweetened with fructose than they did after drinking beverages that contained another simple sugar, glucose. This may mean that fructose tricks you into eating more calories than your body needs. The result? You gain weight.<br><br>High-fructose foods may interfere with the signaling system that controls your appetite for all foods. We have discovered another way in which a high- fructose diet encourages overeating. Chronic consumption of sugary foods seems to promote biochemical changes that prevent the brain from receiving messages from appetite hormones--even when you are not consuming fructose. We have shown that this phenomenon leads to substantial weight gain in animals, and some studies suggest that it occurs in humans who consume too much fructose, too.<br><br>Fructose may sabotage weight-loss efforts. Your body does not metabolize fructose in the same way that it processes other sugars. When fructose enters a cell, enzymes break it down. Unfortunately, the actions of these enzymes raise blood pressure, increase blood levels of artery-clogging fat, and eventually cause obesity. As if that weren't bad enough, eating fructose actually increases your body's production of the very enzymes that cause all of these problems. Over time, your body may produce such a high concentration of these enzymes that eating foods that contain even a small amount of fructose will set in motion all of the powerful biological changes that we believe cause obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other related conditions. This phenomenon may help explain why obese people struggle to lose weight and keep it off: Their bodies become ultraresponsive to fructose.<br><br>People who consume a lot of soft drinks and fruit juice--two major sources of fructose--tend to be overweight. Several large population studies have shown that people who drink beverages sweetened with fructose are more likely to be overweight than people who avoid soft drinks and juice. The "Supersize Me!" phenomenon is partly to blame. HFCS is cheaper than refined sugar, so fast-food restaurants and the beverage industry have been able to sell extra-large servings of soda and other fructose-rich beverages at low prices, which has led people to consume more calories. Soft drinks appear to pose another problem for anyone trying to control their weight and stay healthy. Consuming fructose rapidly--the way you might when gulping down a cola or bottle of fruit juice--causes levels of this sugar to soar in the blood. Studies suggest that could lead to greater weight gain.<br><br>Beyond Obesity<br><br>As every doctor learns in medical school, obesity raises the risk for many common conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and kidney disease, among others. As I just explained, strong evidence suggests that consuming too much fructose will make you gain an unhealthy amount of weight. Recent research has revealed that exposing the body to too much fructose makes you sick in other ways, independent of its effect on weight. In fact, I believe that consuming excessive amounts of fructose not only is making the United States one of the fattest nations in the world, but it also is hastening the rise of several of the leading killers in this country.<br><br>Indeed, even if you are currently eating a low-calorie diet and you are at a stable weight--or even if you are currently losing weight--you may still be creating health problems if your diet contains too much fructose. Actually, you could end up developing many of the complications associated with obesity, even though you are not obese. With this in mind, it's worth noting that rates of several other serious conditions, in addition to obesity, have soared at the same time that consumption of fructose has risen.<br><br>High blood pressure. Over the past 30 years, the number of Americans with high blood pressure has climbed by 20 percent. About 73 million people in this country have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, making it the most common disease in the United States. While hypertension often has no symptoms, it can have serious consequences, because it raises the risk for stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease.<br><br>Type 2 diabetes. The incidence of diabetes in the United States has increased by about 35 percent since 1994. A rare disease in this country as recently as the late 19th century, diabetes now affects more than 20 million Americans. New cases of type 2 diabetes account for almost all of this dramatic rise. This condition used to be called adult-onset diabetes, but its name was changed to reflect the unfortunate new reality: Like obesity and hypertension, type 2 diabetes has become commonplace among children and adolescents.<br><br>Kidney disease. During the past quarter-century, the incidence of end-stage renal disease, or kidney failure, has nearly quadrupled. Meanwhile, about 20 million Americans have mild to moderate degrees of kidney disease. Unfortunately, while treatment can slow its progression, there is little we can do to stop it completely.<br><br>Liver disease. In the past, a condition known as fatty liver occurred primarily in poorly nourished alcoholics. Now we know that too much nourishment--that is, overeating, which results in obesity--can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Once exceedingly rare, NAFLD now affects 15 to 30 percent of Americans, including 6.5 million children. This disease can lead to complete liver failure and has become one of the most common reasons for liver transplantation. Recent studies by our group strongly suggest that consuming too much fructose may cause this condition.</p><h2>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: The Strife of Love in a Dream</h2><p>The first, complete, English-language translation in five hundred years of one of the world&#39;s most compelling fantasies. It is hard to believe that one of the most famous books in the world, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, read by every Renaissance intellectual and referred to and revered in studies of art and culture ever since, has never appeared in full in English. One reason, no doubt, is the length and difficulty of the text. It is a strange, pagan, pedantic, erotic, allegorical, mythological romance relating in highly stylized Italian the quest of Poliphilo for his beloved Polia. The author (presumed to be Francesco Colonna, a friar of dubious reputation) was obsessed--one might say sexually obsessed--by architecture, and the book&#39;s 174 woodcuts are a primary source for Renaissance ideas on both buildings and gardens. In 1592 a beginning was made to produce an English version but the translator gave up part way. Now, at last, the task has been triumphantly performed by Joscelyn Godwin, who succeeds in reproducing all the wayward charm and arcane learning of the book in language accessible to the modern reader. Printed in the same size and format as the original, the book includes all the woodcuts and has a substantial introduction by Professor Godwin. Its appearance is a publishing event, filling a notorious gap in every academic library, in the collections of scholars, and on the bookshelves of everyone interested in the history of Western culture.</p><p>Joscelyn Godwin is Professor of Music at Colgate University. He has made a considerable contribution to occult philosophy through his books on the seventeenth-century mystical writers Robert Fludd and Athanasius Kircher, as well as on the mystery religions of the ancient world and on the spiritual dimension of music.During December of 1499 in Venice, Aldus Manutius finished printing <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: The Strife of Love in a Dream</i>, a brilliantly designed folio filled with elaborate engraved plates that may have bankrupted its publisher and has nearly bankrupted collectors ever since. ...It is hard to think of any book quite so sensuous. It intoxicated European writers for two centuries, although few were so foolish as to try imitation, for Colonna invented his own language, an Italian so crammed with words borrowed from recondite Latin sources that it bewildered even his learned countrymen. At last, Joscelyn Godwin, a professor of music at Colgate University known widely for studies of ancient mystical religions, provides the first clear English version. No translation, if it is to be useful, could reproduce the effect of the original, but Godwin gives a hint, rendering a small passage literally and hilariously. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, D.J.R. Bruckner, 26 December 1999</i></p><h2>Washed in Gold: The Story Behind the Biggest Money-Laundering Investigation in U.S. History</h2><p>Offers the compelling story of a high-level drug investigation, money laundering scheme, and bitter battles among government agencies involving a cocaine and financial operation so huge that L.A. investigators--where &#34;the Mine&#34; was based--refused to believe it existed.</p><p>This sprawling account of a drug and money-laundering case eventually gets bogged down in its own details. Woolner, associate editor at the Fulton County Daily Report, a legal newspaper in Atlanta, begins promisingly. In 1986, Ram�n Costello (a pseudonym), an American living in Colombia caught in a cocaine deal, agreed in a plea bargain with Atlanta-based federal prosecutors to help set up a money-laundering operation to catch big-time drug traffickers. Costello then linked undercover federal agents with an associate connected to another money-laundering investigation in Los Angeles, and he himself met with notorious Colombian traffickers Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar. Woolner uses reconstructed dialogue to advance the story, as well as close description of episodes like an antsy moment in a New York City restaurant: New York area Drug Enforcement Agency agents who were throwing a party in a restaurant had to pretend not to recognize an Atlanta DEA agent who, as part of an undercover operation, had brought a money launderer to eat paella and deal in the same restaurant. However, the narrative grows too big for Woolner to handle clearly. A DEA operation uncovered La Mina (The Mine), a money laundry working out of Los Angeles and New York City. Competing agents from those cities, as well as from Atlanta, refused for a long time to recognize the links among their cases, and interagency turf wars also hampered investigation. Then, in February 1989, agents arrested money launderers in the LA and NYC jewelry districts. Prosecutors also got a guilty plea from a dirty Panamanian bank. Although the sham money-laundering operation organized by Costello didn't bring in a major Colombian drug dealer, it did net an associate launderer, Eduardo Mart�nez. An interesting story, but this book flits so messily among characters and settings that it becomes wearying. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>During a sting involving a phony money-laundering scheme, the Atlanta branch of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began to hear about la Mina ("the Mine"), a large, efficient operation responsible for cleansing millions in drug-dirty money. The DEA gradually traced a web of banks, couriers, and front men who moved physical and electronic money around the world, mainly between Colombia and the United States. As other DEA branches as well as the FBI and the IRS became involved, the coordination of the investigation became more complex, and turf wars among the agencies grew intense. Eventually, the Mine was closed down, and a number of major players went to jail. Woolner gives this story its complicated due, following the international investigation in great detail. When she focuses on the Atlanta probe involving informant Ramon Costello, who ultimately ensnared two mid-level players, the story moves crisply. But at other times, the plot tends to disappear in a multitude of details and participants. As a result, the book's appeal will probably be limited.

The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life.

In <i>Zen: Its History and Teachings,</i> the noted mystic explains that Zen has no rituals, no chanting, no mantras, no scriptures &#x2014; only short, evocative parables and teachings that make it ideal for the modern seeker. Using his characteristic humorous, encouraging style, Osho guides readers through the origins and development of this seminal spiritual tradition that is neither religion nor dogma nor creed. He provides a context for those who have not been born into the Zen tradition, introducing them to its timeless approach to existence. The book argues that the only preparation for fully experiencing Zen's power is meditative awareness, and Osho presents simple techniques to achieve this awareness.

Beginning in 1920, when she was still in her teens, Norma Wallace managed a high-class bordello for an affluent and influential clientele, evading the police and asserting her sexual freedom "like a man" despite the nominal confines of several rickety marriages. Obsessive love for a man 39 years her junior and her first-ever jail term finally put Wallace out of the business in the mid-1960s, but her memories were still vivid and raunchy when she tape-recorded material for an autobiography in the two years before her suicide in 1974. Novelist Christine Wiltz makes good use of those recordings in an earthy narrative filled with great anecdotes, from how the name of Wallace's dog became local slang for an out-of-town customer to the time an undertaker's premises served as her temporary place of business. Wiltz also interviewed many of Wallace's lovers and associates; she draws on popular journalism and scholarly monographs with equal acuity to flesh out Norma's story. Her perceptive biography of a colorful and complex woman is equally satisfying as a social history of 20th-century New Orleans. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Writing <i>The Last Madam: A Life in the New Orleans Underworld</i> began with a call from Norma Wallace's fifth husband's wife.&nbsp; Jean Bernard had decided it was time to do something with all the papers Norma had left that were stuffed into a tall secretary in her living room.&nbsp; Norma had begun taping her life, and Jean invited me over to review those tapes.&nbsp; That was the beginning of a five year journey for me.&nbsp; Even though Norma's house was the last of the wide-open French Quarter parlor houses and everyone from the mayor down knew she operated (she had an opening in a wall of the room she called the Music Room where she slipped the police their "take"), Norma lived a life of discretion in deference to her customers.&nbsp; Her "tell-all" tapes left a lot out, and so over five years I interviewed people she'd mentioned, politicos from as far back as the fifties (she operated for over forty years), a former Chief of Police, and all the while trying to find men who had gone to the house who would talk and locating one of her girls.&nbsp; I finally found both.&nbsp; The "girl" was one of the most amazing women I've ever met, Rose Mary Miorana, who Norma called the worst hooker in the world but who was her life-long friend.&nbsp; Rose Mary had a child with severe cerebral palsy whom she'd kept alive for over thirty years, and who was as charming as she was.&nbsp; I shaped the story out of interviews with her and over 100 others to tell the story of a woman who was way ahead of her time--powerful, wealthy, and who married five times, each husband younger than the one before, until she met Wayne Bernard who was 39 years younger.</p><h2>Chilly Scenes of Winter</h2><p>This is the story of a love-smitten Charles; his friend Sam, the Phi Beta Kappa and former coat salesman; and Charles&#39; mother, who spends a lot of time in the bathtub feeling depressed.</p><p>8 1-hour cassettesIt is the story of love-smitten Charles; his friend Sam, the unemployed Phi Beta Kappa college graduate; and Charles&#39;s mother, who spends much of her time in the bathtub feeling depressed.

Gathered from the mass of his published works -- including The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity, The Four Loves, and God in the Dock -- as well as from letters, essays, and less familiar writings, this compendium contains a cross section of Lewis&#39;s finest work.</p><h2>Anne Frank&#39;s Tales from the Secret Annex</h2><p>Hiding from the Nazis in the "Secret Annexe"&nbsp;&nbsp;of an old office building in Amsterdam, a&nbsp;&nbsp;thirteen-year-old girl named Anne Frank became a writer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The now famous diary of her private life and&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts reveals only part of Anne's story, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;This book completes the portrait of this remarkable&nbsp;&nbsp;and talented young&nbsp;&nbsp;author.<br><br><i>Tales from the Secret Annex</i> is a&nbsp;&nbsp;complete collection of Anne Frank's lesser-known&nbsp;&nbsp;writings: short stories, fables, personal reminiscences,&nbsp;&nbsp;and an unfinished novel.

Anne and her family were persecuted alongside millions of Jews prior to and during World War II for their faith.&nbsp; It was during this period on her 13th birthday that Anne recieved a diary in which she wrote her life story. Forced to flee their home and go into hiding, the Frank family was eventually seperated, with Anne and her sister Margot being placed in Bergen-Belsen. In 1945, years after their initial seperation, it was discovered that both Anne and her sister were killed, leaving only her beloved diary behind.<b>Was There a Break-in?<br><br>Wednesday evening, March 24, 1943<br><br></b>Mother, Father, Margot and I were sitting quite pleasantly together when Peter suddenly came in and whispered in Father's ear. I caught the words "a barrel falling over in the warehouse" and "someone fiddling with the door."<br><br>Margot heard it too, but was trying to calm me down, since I'd turned white as chalk and was extremely nervous. The three of us waited. In the meantime Father and Peter went downstairs, and a minute or two later Mrs. van Daan came up from where she'd been listening to the radio. She told us that Pim had asked her to switch it off and tiptoe upstairs. But you know what happens when you're trying to be quiet--the old stairs creaked twice as loud. Five minutes later Peter and Pim, the color drained from their faces, appeared again to relate their experiences.<br><br>They had positioned themselves under the staircase and waited. Nothing happened. Then all of a sudden they heard a couple of bangs, as if two doors had been slammed shut inside the house. Pim bounded up the stairs, while Peter went to warn Dussel, who finally presented himself upstairs, though not without kicking up a fuss and making a lot of noise. Then we all tiptoed in our stockinged feet to the van Daan family on the next floor. Mr. van D. had a bad cold and had already gone to bed, so we gathered around his bedside and discussed our suspicions in a whisper.<br><br>Every time Mr. van D. coughed loudly, Mrs. van D. and I nearly had a nervous fit. He kept coughing until someone came up with the bright idea of giving him codeine. His cough subsided immediately.<br><br>Once again we waited and waited, but heard nothing. Finally we came to the conclusion that the burglars had fled when they heard footsteps in an otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chairs in the private office were neatly grouped round the radio, which was tuned to England. If the burglars had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, that would get the ball rolling, and there could be very serious repercussions. So Mr. van Daan got up, pulled on his coat and pants, put on his hat and cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter (armed with a heavy hammer, to be on the safe side) right behind him. The ladies (including Margot and me) waited in suspense until the men returned five minutes later and told us that there was no sign of any activity in the building. We agreed not to run any water or flush the toilet; but since everyone's stomach was churning from all the tension, you can imagine the stench after we'd each had a turn in the bathroom.<br><br>Incidents like these are always accompanied by other disasters, and this was no exception. Number one: the Westertoren bells stopped chiming, and they were always so comforting. Plus Mr. Voskuijl left early last night, and we weren't sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the door.<br><br>Well, the night had just begun, and we still weren't sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact that between eight-fifteen--when the burglar had first entered the building--and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more we thought about it, the less likely it seemed that a burglar would have forced a door so early in the evening, when there were still people out on the streets. Besides that, it occurred to us that the warehouse manager at the Keg Company next door might still have been at work. What with the excitement and the thin walls, it's easy to mistake the sounds. Besides, your imagination often plays tricks on you in moments of danger.<br><br>So we lay down on our beds, though not to sleep. Father and Mother and Mr. Dussel were awake most of the night, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I hardly got a wink of sleep. This morning the men went downstairs to see if the outside door was still locked, but all was well!<br><br>Of course, we gave the entire office staff a blow-by-blow account of the incident, which had been far from pleasant. It's much easier to laugh at these kinds of things after they've happened, and Bep was the only one who took us seriously.<br><br>Note: The next morning the toilet was clogged, and Father had to stick in a long wooden pole and fish out several pounds of excrement and strawberry recipes (which is what we use for toilet paper these days). Afterward we burned the pole.<br><br><b>The Dentist<br><br>Wednesday, December 8, 1942<br><br></b>The nicest spectacle I've ever seen here took place today: Mother was ironing and Mrs. van Daan was scheduled for a dental appointment. Dussel began unpacking his case with an air of importance (it was the first time he'd worked on anyone here), and he needed some eau de cologne, which could be used as a disinfectant, and vaseline, which would have to do for wax. Mrs. van D. sat down, and he started looking in her mouth, but every time he touched a tooth, the poor woman flinched and uttered incoherent cries. After a lengthy examination (lengthy as far as Mrs. van D. was concerned, since it actually took no longer than two minutes), Dussel began to scrape out a cavity. But Mrs. van D. had no intention of letting him. She flailed her arms and legs until Dussel finally let go of his probe and . . . it remained stuck in Mrs. van D.'s tooth. That really did it! Mrs. van D. lashed out wildly in all directions, cried (as much as you can with an instrument like that in your mouth), tried to remove it, but only managed to push it in even farther. Mr. Dussel calmly observed the scene, his hands on his hips, while the rest of the audience roared with laughter. Of course, that was very mean of us. If it'd been me, I'm sure I would have yelled even louder. After a great deal of squirming, kicking, screaming and shouting, she finally managed to yank the thing out, and Mr. Dussel calmly went on with his work as if nothing had happened. He was so quick that Mrs. van D. didn't have time to pull any more shenanigans. But then, he had more help than he's ever had before: no fewer than two assistants; Mr. van D. and I performed our job well. The whole scene resembled one of those engravings from the Middle Ages, the kind showing a quack at work. In the meantime, however, the patient was getting restless, since she had to keep an eye on "her" soup and "her" food. One thing is certain: Mrs. van D. will never make another dental appointment!<br><br><b>Sausage Day<br><br>Friday, December 10, 1942<br><br></b>Mr. van Daan had a large amount of meat. Today he wanted to make bratwurst and sausages, and tomorrow mettwurst. It's fun watching him put the meat through the grinder: once, twice, three times. Then he adds all kinds of ingredients to the meat and uses a long pipe, which he attaches to the grinder, to force it into the casings. We ate the bratwurst with sauerkraut (served with onions and potatoes) for lunch, but the sausages were hung to dry over a pole suspended from the ceiling. Everyone who came into the room burst into laughter when they saw those dangling sausages. It was such a comical sight.<br><br>The place was a shambles. Mr. van Daan, clad in his wife's apron and looking fatter than ever, was concentrating his hefty form on the meat. What with his bloody hands, red face and apron, he really looked like a butcher. Mrs. van D. was trying to do everything at once: learn Dutch, cook, watch, sigh, moan--she claims to have broken a rib. That's what happens when you do such stupid physical exercises. Dussel had an eye infection and was sitting next to the stove dabbing his eye with camomile tea. Pim, seated in the sunshine, kept having to move his chair this way and that to stay out of the way. His back must have been bothering him, because he was sitting slightly hunched over with an agonized expression on his face. He reminded me of those aged invalids you see in the poorhouse. Peter was romping around the room with the cat, holding out a piece of meat and then running off with the meat still in his hands. Mother, Margot and I were peeling potatoes. When you get right down to it, none of us were doing our work properly, because we were all so busy watching Mr. van Daan.<br><br><b>The Flea<br><br>Wednesday, July 7, 1943<br><br></b>We're being plagued with yet another problem: Mouschi's fleas. We didn't know that people could be bitten by cat fleas, but they can.<br><br>Yesterday when I was upstairs I found a flea on my leg, ten minutes later when I was downstairs I nabbed another one, and last night when I was sitting on Dussel's bed, I felt another one crawling down my leg, but the little critter slipped through my fingers--they're incredibly fast. This morning I was getting dressed over by the closet when I saw another one of those wondrous creatures, walking along as pretty as you please. A flea that walks as well as jumps is a new experience for me. I picked it up and squeezed as hard as I could, but Mr. Flea hopped away again. Sighing, I got undressed and subjected my naked body and my clothes to a thorough examination until I finally found the flea in my panties. A second later, it was off with his head.<br><br><b>Do You Remember?<br><br>Memories of my schooldays at the Jewish Lyceum<br><br></b>Do you remember? I've spent many a delightful hour talking about school, teachers, adventures and boys. Back when our lives were still normal, everything was so wonderful. That one year of Lyceum was heaven to me: the teachers, the things I learned, the jokes, the prestige, the crushes, the admirers.<br><br>Do you remember? When I came back from town that afternoon and found a package in the mailbox from "un ami, R." It could only have come from Rob Cohen. Inside there was a brooch worth at least two and a half guilders. Ultra-modern. Rob's father sold that kind of stuff. I wore it for two days, and then it broke.<br><br>Do you remember? How Lies and I told on the class. We had a French test. I wasn't having too much trouble with it, but Lies was. She copied my answers and I went over them to make corrections (on her test, I mean).

Worlds in which genetically and cybernetically altered races battle for supremacy... in which love is a high-tech weapon, eternal youth is an option, and intelligence is the greatest treat to survival...</p><p>This collection gathers twelve tales by one of the leading new voices in science fiction. The stories are divided into three groups: Five fall into Sterling's "Shaper/Mechanist" coterie of tales; three are science fiction of a more generic type; and four tales are labeled as fantasy. The Shaper/Mechanist stories center on a future world in which two opposing sects have developed: the "Shapers" have evolved themselves through genetic tinkering; the "Mechanists" through computerized prosthetics. Sterling explores the consequences of both approaches, painting neither side as necessarily good nor evil, and stories are related Erom both points of view. Among the other tales, "20 Evocations" effectively links anecdotal episodes of Nikolai Leng's life to create a coherent picture of Leng's gradual transformation from young innocent to cornipt elder. In "Spook," the earth has suffered a "brain drain" through mass emigrations to space leaving a world populated mainly with "undesirables." The powers-diat-be have their hands full trying to maintain a semblance of order and control; faced with a potential uprising in Central America, they contract the services of a futuristic secret agent-the "spook" of the title-to quell the insurgency. The denouement to this space-age thriller is devasting. "Green Days in Brunei" is set in the tiny nation of Brunei on the island of Borneo to which Canadian engineer Turner Choi has been dispatched to help introduce a bit of twenty-first-century technology to a society that has previously rejected high tech to the point of outlawing telephones. Choi eventually becomes romantically involved with the royal princess of Brunei in this, what may well be Sterling's best story. The fantasy-oriented tales which close out the collection largely feature a tongue-in-cheek tone and are, unfortunately, not as interesting as the preceding works. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Sterling ( Islands in the Net ) is one of the very best young science fiction writers, and one of the foremost exponents of cyberpunk (he edited Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology ). His first collection brings together a dozen of his evocative, inventive, beautifully written stories. "Spook" tells of a future intelligence agent who is subjected to an operation that removes the psychologically limiting Veil implanted in his head, and then finds freedom untenable because it brings realization of all the suffering he has caused. "The Little Magic Shop" is a whimsical story about life-extending elixir, with a twist. Five of the stories are from the Shaper/Mechanist series, set in a future in which the two races war for the universe's resources. "Swarm" tells of a Shaper who craftily gathers some genetic material from the alien Swarm race with the intent of creating a slave population, but whose plans backfire spectacularly when his understanding of the Swarm proves less advanced than his technology. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Essiac Essentials: Rene Caisse&#39;s Herbal Cancer Remedy</h2><p>Essiac is a popular herbal remedy of American origin which has a proven record of helping people with cancer. Essiac is made from blending four effective and commonly available herbs into a tea. The formula originally came from a Native American medicine-man who used it successfully to treat an English woman with breast cancer. Thirty years later this same woman passed on the recipe to Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse. Rene researched and developed the recipe, giving it the name Essiac (an anagram of her own name) and for fifty-four years used it to treat cancer patients, always refusing to accept any payment. Today, Essiac has an international reputation and is recommended by complementary and medical practitioners, cancer centres and hospices world-wide. &#39;Essiac Essentials&#39; gives detailed information on how to grow, harvest or obtain the herbs commercially and a simple-to-follow recipe. It also contains case histories of Essiac users, spanning sixty years, including moving testimonies from some of Rene Caisse&#39;s original patients. This is the only book which gives reliable information about Rene Caisse&#39;s original recipe as verified by Mary McPherson, her close friend and helper for more than forty years. Other books by Mali Klein and Sheila Snow Essiac Secrets.</p><p>Sheila Snow knew Rene Caisse personally and was given access to her papers. She lives in Ontario, Canada.

The inclusion of a broad sampling of histories and theories attests to multiple, even competing postcolonialisms, while the skillful organization of the volume provides a useful map of the field in terms of recognizable patterns, shared family resemblances, and common genealogies.</p><p>The book is divided into nine sections: Ideologies of Imperialism, The Critique of Colonial Discourse, The Politics of Language and Literary Studies, Nationalisms and Nativisms, Hybrid Identities, Gender and Sexualities, Reading the Subaltern, Comparative (Post)colonialisms, and Globalization and Postcoloniality.

With help from coauthor Gavan Daws, the label's then head, Jac Holzman, collects his reminiscences and those of many of his cohorts in the enlightening, often hilarious <i>Follow the Music: The Life and High Times of Elektra Records in the Great Years of American Pop Culture</i>. This oral history follows Holzman's exploits from his days as a producer of small pressings of obscure folk music to his signing of rockers like Jim Morrison and Arthur Lee and his eventual sale of the company and subsequent departure. Before he left, though, Holzman and friends had irrevocably altered, as he says, the "recording technique, packaging, marketing and the behavioral sciences of rock and roll." <i>--Rickey Wright</i>Jac Holzman founded Elektra Records in 1950. For 23 years he was the companys president and driving force. In 1970 the label was acquired by Warner Communications. In 1973 Jac left Elektra, continuing with Warner as Chief Technologist. In 1982 he became chairman on Panavision. In 1986 he created FirstMedia, a closely held firm investing in communications, which acquired Cinema Products, makers of the Steadicam. In 1991 Jac came back to music, establishing the Discovery family of labels, which are now part of Sire Records Group, a division of the Warner Music Group. These days, California based Jac loves to fly his single-engine Bonanza, which he hangars at Santa Monica Airport. <p>Gavan Daws and Jac have been friends for more than 25 years.

Based on Mailer&#39;s own experience of military service in the Philippines during World War Two, &#39;The Naked and the Dead&#39; is a graphically truthful and shattering portrayal of ordinary men in battle. First published in 1949, as America was still basking in the glories of the Allied victory, it altered forever the popular perception of warfare. Focusing on the experiences of a fourteen-man platoon stationed on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific during World War II, and written in a journalistic style, it tells the moving story of the soldiers&#39; struggle to retain a sense of dignity amidst the horror of warfare, and to find a source of meaning in their lives amisdst the sounds and fury of battle.</p><p>In addition to thirty-one works of fiction and nonfiction, Norman Mailer has written numerous poems and essays, as well as directed and appeared in motion pictures. His new collection of essays, The Time of Our Time, will be published in May 1998. He lives in New York.&#39;Mailer recorded every foul thought and word of his characters, wrote about ignorant, savage, primitive men. For maturity of viewpoint, for technical competence, and for stark dramatic power, The Naked and the Dead is an incredibly finished performance.&#39; New York Times</p><h2>Lipstick Traces : A Secret History of the Twentieth Century</h2><p>This title is about a single, serpentine fact: late in 1976 a record called &#34;Anarchy in the UK&#34; was issued in London, an event which launched a transformation of pop music all over the world. The song distilled, in crudely poetic form, a critique of modern society once set out by a small group of Paris intellectuals. In Greil Marcus&#39;s classic book on punk, Dadaism, the situationists, medieval heretics and the Knights of the Round Table (amongst others), the greatest cultural critic of our times unravels the secret history of the 20th century.</p><p>Greil Marcus was born in San Francisco in 1945. He is the author of Mystery Train, Invisible Republic, Lipstick Traces and Double Trouble, and the editor of Lester Bangs&#39;s Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung. In 1998 he curated the exhibition &#39;1948&#39; at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Marcus writes a bi-weekly column for salon.com and a monthly column for Interview. He was described by John Rockwell in the New York Times as &#39;a writer of rare perception and a genuinely innovative thinker&#39;. Greil Marcus lives in Berkeley, California.Marcus ( Mystery Train ) believes that rock songs of groups like the Sex Pistols filter into mass consciousness and subtly influence everyday speech and thought. His underlying premise is that pop culture, like radical protest, is capable of altering history. He traces a common thread presumed to link the rebelliousness of punk rockers, medieval religious heretics, the Dada antics of Tristan Tzara and Hugo Ball, the films of the anarchist group Situationist International and the anti-bourgeois ravings and graffiti of the lettrist movement in post-war Paris. Marcus contrasts what he sees as the spurious pop revolt of Michael Jackson with Elvis Presley and the Beatles, "who raised the possibility of living in a new way." This deliberately meandering tour of countercultural high and low roads is illustrated with rock posters and handbills, news clippings, photographs, protest art. In this version of history, Little Richard's glossolalia has direct ties to the pre-Christian Essenes. Rock critic Marcus is consistently entertaining even if he doesn't prove his thesis. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Coleridge Early Visions</h2><p>The first volume (winner of the 1989 Whitbread Prize for Book of the Year) of Richard Holmes&#39;s two-volume Coleridge biography which transforms our view of this greatest of Romantic poets. Coleridge: Early Visions is the first part of a major new biography of Coleridge which will transform our view of the poet of `Kubla Khan&#39; and his place in the Romantic Movement. Dismissed by much recent scholarship as an opium addict, plagiarist, political apostate and mystic charlatan, Richard Holmes&#39;s Coleridge leaps out of the page as a brilliant, animated and endlessly provoking figure who invades the imagination.This is an act of biographical recreation which brings back to life the poetry, Coleridge&#39;s encyclopaedic thought, his creative energy and physical presence. He is vivid and unexpected. Holmes draws the reader into the labyrinthine complications of his subject&#39;s personality and literary power, and faces us with profound questions about the nature of creativity, the relations between sexuality and friendship, the shifting grounds of political and religious belief.</p><p>Richard Holmes is the author of The Age of Wonder, which won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and the National Book Critics Circle Award and was one of the ten New York Times' Best Books of the Year in 2009. His balloon book, Falling Upwards, was chosen as a Best Book of the Year by seven newspapers in 2013. His other biographies include Shelley: The Pursuit (winner of the 1974 Somerset Maugham Prize), Coleridge: Early Visions (winner of the 1989 Whitbread Book of the Year Award), Coleridge: Darker Reflections (shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize and winner of the Duff Cooper Prize), and Dr. Johnson &amp; Mr. Savage (winner of the 1993 James Tait Black Prize). This Long Pursuit completes the autobiographical trilogy begun in Footsteps (1985) and Sidetracks (2000). Holmes was awarded the OBE in 1992, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, in 2010. He is the 2018 winner of the BIO Award presented by the Biographers International Organization for sustained achievement in biography. He lives in London and Norwich with the novelist Rose Tremain.A winner of the Whitbread Prize for biography, this first of what will be a two-volume biography of Coleridge is superb. Holmes ( Footsteps, LJ 9/15/85; Shelly, LJ 5/15/75) has indeed "taken Coleridge into the open air." By brushing aside the givens of critical opinion without dismissing them and making extensive use of the letters and notebooks, a fresher Coleridge emerges. It is still the Coleridge with drug and financial problems, a tendency toward plagiarism and murky thought, the dreaming schemer, but he somehow comes out of this account more a fascinating character than a literary relic. The British rave-ish reviews are well deserved, as this work promises to become a standard. The one thing Holmes tends to gloss over is Coleridge's philosophical background, but this background is well covered elswhere, and Holmes hints that he may do more in Volume 2. Definitely buy this title over Stephen Weissman's His Brother's Keeper: A Psychobiography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge ( LJ 1/90).<br><i>- Robert E. Brown, Onondaga Cty.

Pregnancy can also be a time of physical and psychological stress. By embracing the bounty of nature and the healing power of herbs, you can find treatments for the common discomforts that come with pregnancy and also immerse yourself in a world of self-nurturing and pampering that will be amazingly beneficial to you and your baby. Here is your guide to a holistic approach to pregnancy -- one that combines diet, exercise, massage, and aromatherapy, as well as safe, simple, at-home remedies and beauty routines that you will want to continue once you welcome your new baby into the world. <b>The Pregnancy Herbal</b> offers a wealth of accessible information, such as:<br>* Remedies for morning sickness, insomnia, swollen ankles, and other common pregnancy complaints<br>* Recipes for a nature-based diet to balance your moods<br>* Massage and aromatherapy treatments to relax and calm you<br>* How to enjoy an herbal day spa in your own home<br>* Herbal first-aid for mother and baby<br><br>In <b>The Pregnancy Herbal</b>, Jaqulene Harper-Roth gives women the key to enjoying every stage of their pregnancy -- from before conception to after birth -- along with a totally natural and safe regimen for lasting health and beauty.</p><p>JAQULENE HARPER-ROTH is a certified holistic nutritionist, an accredited homeopathic and color healer, and the author of <b>Beautiful Face, Beautiful Body</b>. Married and the mother of three small children, Harper-Roth lives in North Carolina.<b>Thyme for an Introduction</b><br><br>Why another book on pregnancy?<br><br>Even more to the point, why a book about herbal pregnancy--a book that equates the health and well-being of you and your growing baby with a reliance on naturally occurring foods, medicinal remedies, and beauty treatments?<br><br>Well . . . you are a reflection of what you eat.<br><br>That old saying is doubly true when you are pregnant: you and your baby are both what you eat. I believe your skin, general appearance, and health all reflect the food you give your body on a daily basis. When I became pregnant with my first child and realized I would soon be giving life to another growing person, I decided to seek out the purest foods available. To find those foods, I turned to nature.<br><br>I'd originally become a vegetarian at the age of nineteen to cure a skin condition that I had suffered since I was a teenager. Simply changing my diet brought that chronic condition under control, and I began immersing myself in the fascinating field of alternative medicine and disease prevention and became a dedicated student of herbal healing.<br><br>During those years I was living in the English countryside, where I could easily forage for wild edible foods and native herbs. I soon discovered that regardless of what ailed me, the cure was available for the taking in the fields and hedgerows near my home. The herbs and flowers I used were plentiful in the spring and summer months: soon I learned techniques for preserving their living essences, and I was able to continue using their potent botanical extracts through autumn and winter, as well. I kept abundant supplies of green life in my kitchen and bathroom--trays, jars, and bottles full of sprouting seeds, nuts, beans, and legumes.<br><br>The next logical step was using these same foods as my primary source of nutrition. I took a good long look at the things I had stored in my kitchen cabinets and refrigerator--and got rid of them. The more I experimented, the more I realized that I needed only the herbs, fruits, flowers, seeds, nuts, and other natural resources growing outside my door to maintain the healthy lifestyle I sought. Soon my grocery bill for the week was less than twenty dollars. I ate with the seasons: I grew what I could and foraged for the rest.<br><br>Nature's pantry provided not only nutrition and health remedies but beauty treatments as well. When I ate fresh fruit, I used the skin or peel for a quick active-enzyme facial. I ground nuts and seeds into fine meal and mixed them with cold-pressed plant oils to make a soothing scrub or hand-washing paste. I stopped washing with commercial soaps (of any brand); instead, I splashed my skin each morning with sparkling mineral water, infused with essential oils rich in nutrients. For a change of pace, I used flower-infused oils and fresh coconut milk to keep my skin supple and lock in moisture.<br><br>This simple lifestyle was not only healthy and pleasurable for mind and body but also affordable, even on the very low income I had then. Bringing nature and herbal lore into my life gave me an innate youthfulness, radiant health, and a strong sense of well-being.<br><br><b>And then I got pregnant.</b><br><br>Naturally, I wanted to know more about the experience I was about to have. At local bookstores, I discovered many volumes explaining in great detail what to expect emotionally and physically during pregnancy, and what dietary supplements were required to maintain and promote my health and that of my growing baby, month by month, trimester by trimester. I found books that monitored, informed, and reassured the expectant mother at every turning point. Some talked about what to expect during labor and childbirth, others about how to care for the newborn. Still others talked about finding and/or keeping a loving companionship during pregnancy. I read many of these informative books from cover to cover.<br><br>I found almost nothing about nature and herbal lore in any of these books.<br><br>To me this was a glaring oversight. I knew that, developmentally, the most important time in my child's life was while he or she was within the womb. I also knew that living naturally had brought me to an optimum state of health: could it do any less for my child?<br><br>In the volumes I read, I also found relatively little about the importance of feeling good about yourself and the way you look throughout the nine (plus) months of your pregnancy. I knew how important a positive attitude was toward my own mental well-being: there were times during each of my three pregnancies when I would stare in the mirror and feel a tinge of indignation toward the child growing within me for changing my body.<br><br>My children were born a year apart from each other. Throughout each of those pregnancies and birth experiences, I turned to nature and herbal lore for both nutritional and medicinal remedies for minor ailments and discomforts. I created a green pharmacy using homegrown and wild herbs, compresses, poultices, and tinctures. My medicinal garden grew in the bathroom, my herbal tea garden in the kitchen; in planters along the kitchen and bedroom window sills, I grew edible weeds and flowers. What I couldn't grow, I found in my local supermarket and health-food store.<br><br>Each of my pregnancies furthered my journey into the realm of an herbal lifestyle. I studied macrobiotics, herbalism, vegetarianism, color energy, and sprout nutrition. I was developing the philosophy that forms the core of this book--a unique combination of diet, exercise, spa treatments, and aromatherapy that not only relaxed and invigorated me but also made me feel good about myself at every stage of pregnancy. After my children were born, the importance of bathing rituals, massage, and safe, nontoxic earth remedies was self-evident and something I encouraged for the whole family.<br><br>In 1992 I received three higher national diplomas (HNDs) in nutritional medicine (a therapy that adapts a person's diet in order to improve both mental and physical health), chromopsychology and healing (the study and application of colored-light energy to heal diseases of the mind and body), naturopathy (a system of therapy that depends on the healing powers of sleep, exercise, and food), herbalism (also known as medical pharmacology, the use of plants to prevent or cure disease), and homeopathy (a system of care that uses minerals and herbs to treat a wide variety of acute health problems brought about by stress). I then went to work spreading the word about the benefits of living within nature and her laws.<br><br>The book you now hold in your hands, <b>The Pregnancy Herbal</b>, is the culmination of those many years of experimentation and study. The recipes and techniques contained herein constitute a holistic approach to pregnancy, an approach that focuses on healing with nutrition and herbal remedies, an approach that also provides techniques for pampering, relaxing, and boosting the self-confidence of the expectant mother.<br><br>With <b>The Pregnancy Herbal</b> as your guide, you will discover how to nourish your own body (and thus, your growing baby's), and how to satisfy your desires, needs, and passions on a daily basis. You will begin feeling revitalized and full of energy, with a refreshed complexion and elastic, toned skin all over your body.<br><br>You will be delighted to discover that there is a natural way of being an expectant mother that brings with it the potential for a united body, mind, and spirit. It is a world of sensual wonders where the mother to be is the center of attention--a world full of delicious, appetizing menus to delight the senses of the most exacting gourmands and to satisfy the concerns of the most experienced nutritionists. It is a world of aromatherapy and massage, where you can learn how to make and use earth-herbal body treatments for your complexion and your growing, stretching body suit; where you can learn to prepare and cook herbal feasts for your yourself and your family.<br><br><b>The Pregnancy Herbal</b> provides you with easy-to-follow instructions for making herbal preparations for your own use and the care and health of your newborn. The book also offers a quick-reference herbal pharmacy with living remedies from the countryside and from your own garden.<br><br>To use this book, you need only the most basic cooking and gardening skills. (I am not a gourmet chef--my children will vouch for that! And I am an impatient gardener, too.)

Edvard Munch came of age during an artistic period that celebrated beauty and design. But in his own art, Munch explored darker themes&#x2015;alienation, sin, and human vulnerability. His resulting work incorporated the vivid colors of previous styles but intensified their emotional power and paved the way for an entirely new approach to painting. Although much has been written about Munch&#x2019;s life and its influence on his art, there has not been a study of the artist&#x2019;s influence on his German and Austrian peers&#x2015;until now. Featuring contributions by leading scholars in the field, including Patricia Bermann, Alison Chang, Jay Clarke, Reinhold Heller, Jill Lloyd, Nils Ohlsen, and Oystein Uvstedt, this authoritative and beautifully illustrated book explores Munch's impact on Austrian and German artists of the period within an Expressionist context. It also examines work in specific media, such as Munch&#x2019;s seminal contributions to printmaking. The artist&#x2019;s thematic and stylistic leitmotifs are highlighted, including self-portraiture, urban scenes, landscapes, couples, and the artist and his model. Vibrant reproductions of works from throughout Munch&#x2019;s oeuvre, including such icons as The Scream, Madonna, and The Kiss, make this a splendid introduction to the artist as well as an exciting springboard to the study of European Expressionism.</p><p>Jill Lloyd is an independent art historian who has curated exhibitions for leading international museums including Tate, Royal Academy London and the National Gallery Washington. She has written extensively on Expressionist and contemporary artists."A timeline provides the major dates of artists, exhibitions, and publications during Munch's lifetime. Munch both inspired and participated in expressionism. His innovations stimulated the expressionists, and he responded to their new styles and drew on common sources of inspiration. Munch's graphics, notably the woodcuts, were central . . . The exhibition, and thus this catalogue, is more of a dialogue than a study of influences.

And in these lairs, men trade the most devastatingly effective techniques ever invented to charm women. This is not fiction. These men really exist. They live together in houses known as Projects. And Neil Strauss, the bestselling author, spent two years living among them, using the pseudonym Style to protect his real-life identity. The result is one of the most explosive and controversial books of the year -- guaranteed to change the lives of men and transform the way women understand the opposite sex forever.</p> <p>On his journey from AFC (average frustrated chump) to PUA (pick-up artist) to PUG (pick-up guru), Strauss not only shares scores of original seduction techniques but also has unforgettable encounters with the likes of Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Heidi Fleiss, and Courtney Love. And then things really start to get strange -- and passions lead to betrayals lead to violence.<em> The Game</em> is the story of one man's transformation from frog to prince -- to prisoner in the most unforgettable book of the year.</p></p><p>Are you just another AFC ("average frustrated chump") trying to meet an HB ("hot babe")? How would you like to "full-close" with a Penthouse Pet of the Year? The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss's entertaining book <i>The Game</i>. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like "half a man." That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss's life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America's most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup "community," a man named Mystery. <p> Mystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he's turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman's tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the "three-second rule"--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like "Do you think magic spells work?" or "Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?" And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile. </p><p> After two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship.

Karen Beaumont's cumulative verse and Jose Aruego and Ariane Dewey's brilliant illustrations will have readers laughing all the way to the surprise ending.</p></p><p><p>Karen Beaumont is the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>I Ain&#x2019;t Gonna Paint No More!</em>; <em>Shoe-la-la!</em>; <em>Who Ate All the Cookie Dough?</em>; <em>Doggone Dogs!</em>; and many other award-winning children&#x2019;s books. She lives in Capitola, California.</p><br><br><p>Jose Aruego&#x2019;s books for young readers have earned the applause of critics, teachers, librarians, and parents&#x2014;as well as the affection of children everywhere. Mr. Aruego&#x2019;s comic animals are immediately recognizable as they cavort through clear, vibrant landscapes, carrying out the action that the simple text has set in motion. It is a style one reviewer has termed &#x201c;illustrative mime.&#x201d;</p><p>Jose Aruego was born in the Philippines, where he studied law. But after practicing briefly, he decided to come to the United States to study graphic arts and advertising at Parsons School of Design in New York City. After graduation, he worked in advertising before taking up the demanding job of cartooning for <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Look</em>, and other magazines.</p><p>Mr. Aruego said: &#x201c;Every Wednesday I would go to the cartoon editor with fifteen or sixteen drawings in hand, from which he might select one for publication. The tension was terrible, because selling cartoons was how I made my living. But I learned a lot from the rejected work, so it wasn&#x2019;t a waste. The sink-or-swim experience of drawing cartoons was how I learned to make the most of a small amount of space.&#x201d; Both abilities have helped him in his career as a children&#x2019;s book author and illustrator, which he began with the publication of <em>The King and His Friends</em> in 1969.</p><p>Although he is known for his amusing characters, Jose Aruego takes writing and drawing for children very seriously. After more than three dozen books he feels he is still learning his craft and getting to know his audience. From the popularity and appeal of Jose Aruego&#x2019;s books, it is obvious that he has both the artistic skill and the imagination to reach the world of children. His work has a distinctive rhythm, and his humorous animal characters have a gaiety and playfulness that children adore.</p><p>&#x201c;Each project teaches me something new and makes me a better artist. Each book brings me closer to children,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have found from making appearances at schools that when kids draw for themselves, most of them like to make funny pictures. So I show them how to draw an alligator. It&#x2019;s a simple drawing and the teachers tell me that after my visit, Aruego alligators show up all over the school.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>As a team, Ariane Dewey and Jose Aruego have illustrated over sixty children's books, including <em>Little Louie the Baby Bloomer</em> and <em>Leo the Late Bloomer</em>. She lives in New York City.</p> <p><b>In Her Own Words...</b></p><p>"My very first memory is of dark blue walls and off-white trim. My mother confirms this unusual baby-girl&#x2019;s-room color scheme in the house where I lived until age one. Possibly this is why one of my favorite colors is darkish blue-jean blue. The other is brilliant orange.</p><p>"As a child I pored over Chicago&#x2019;s Shedd Aquarium catalog of exotically colored fish that seemed too gaudy to be real. My mother and I looked through art books and then sketched portraits of each other or painted watercolors of the armloads of wildflowers we picked. We still love to discuss the subtle juxtapositions of the colorful scenes and objects around us.</p><p>"Art was the most enjoyable part of school. I liked to squish gobs of finger paint on wet paper, or to write, illustrate, and bind stories into books, or, best of all, to paint stage sets for the school plays. I began to look at whatever I saw in terms of which medium&#x2014;oil, pastel, collage, watercolor&#x2014;would best catch the mood and texture before me. At Sarah Lawrence College I majored in painting and sculpture. After graduation I couldn't find an auto body shop willing to lend me space to work on welded sculptures. So I got a job with an industrial design firm doing picture research, among other more mundane tasks, and later became an art editor for a textbook publisher.</p><p>"Soon after that I began writing and illustrating books for children with Jose Aruego, whimsical books with his clever lines and my vivid colors. Jose draws and I paint. We have illustrated some sixty books together, some of which we have also written. Critics have been kind, but, more important, children have been enthusiastic both in the United States and in the many foreign countries where our books have been published.</p><p>"My fingers finally became itchy to do my own drawings, so I started by retelling and illustrating the stories I loved best as a child. A mini-series of regional American tall tales enabled me to indulge my sense of the absurd. These heros and heroines are offbeat, upbeat, irreverent, hilarious, and a lot of fun to draw. Since I also love research, I delight in taking on nonfiction subjects and handling them with fantasy. Color is the basis of my art, while writing and drawing help to describe my colorful visions.</p><p>"Whatever the subject, I want my readers to stretch their imaginations, to see with their minds&#x2019; eyes what happens between one picture and the next. I want to make them explore and smile.</p><p>"I live in New York City with my husband, Claus Dannasch."</p>PreS-Gr. 1. When a dirt-and-stick-covered blob emerges from a mucky mud puddle and starts following nearby farm animals around, they jump to an upsetting conclusion: "Duck, duck, goose . . . / A coyote's on the loose! / Goose, goose, pig . . . / And he's really, really big!" From duck to goose, goose to pig, pig to pup, and so on, news of the prowler spreads in chanting verses that echo the familiar playtime game. Though fairly wispy, the plot of this read-aloud will hold up under repeat performances; the first time through, kids will enjoy the surprise of the coyote's true identity (a bunny in need of a bath); the second time, they'll chuckle over the animals' silly paranoia. Veteran illustrators Aruego and Dewey, whose stock-in-trade is chipper, cartoonlike artwork for preschoolers, capture the story's humor with their startled-looking, amorphously shaped barnyard animals. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Whether it&#x2019;s choosing the right girdle or honing her feminine allure, she measures life by the standards set in women&#x2019;s magazines. But Norma discovers that the real world is less delightful and more sinister than the one portrayed in the glossies. When dark secrets threaten her brother&#x2019;s blossoming romance, Norma must decide whether to sacrifice life in a woman&#x2019;s world for the sake of her brother&#x2019;s happiness. As her decision is slowly revealed, readers realize that, like life in the magazines, Norma isn&#x2019;t quite what she seems.<br>A stunning visual tour de force painstakingly assembled from 40,000 fragments of text snipped from women&#x2019;s magazines, <i>Woman&#x2019;s World</i> is a powerful reflection on society&#x2019;s definition of what it means to be a woman.</p><p>At heart, Rawle's overlong fantasia&#x2014;constructed entirely out of 40,000 text fragments, printed in facsimile, that he cut from 1960s British women's magazines&#x2014;is a tribute to the pulp noir spirit. In suburban England circa 1960, 29-year-old Roy Little suffers from a split personality, apparently the result of a mysterious accident (or was it?) sustained by his sister in childhood. His other self, Norma Fontaine, lives in a dream of the latest fashions, beauty tips and handy hints for the home, watched over by an attentive if disapproving housekeeper, Mary. Or could Mary actually be Roy's mother? We find ourselves rooting for Roy as he applies for a job and meets the attractive, good-humored Eve in a cafe. But Norma keeps rearing her unruly head until one afternoon, she dresses herself to the nines and gets picked up by a photographer, Mr. Hands, with deadly results. British collagiste Rawle charms with sheer campy gumption. The text itself, however, looks like a cut-'n'-paste ransom note. It's fine for a page or two, but becomes wearisome long before the last of the 400-plus pages. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Faust</h2><p><p>IN EARLY 1997, I RECEIVED A telephone call one Saturday morning from my father, who lives in another state. Unlike most of our conversations, which deal with family updates and the like, he began this call with a rather firm declaration. "I know what your next book should be," he said. I had recently completed a book with two dear friends, the late Rex E. Lee and his wife, Janet-and I responded that I did not have plans to write another book. He continued, undeterred, "No, you need to write a biography of- James E. Faust."</p> <p>Though still half asleep, I knew immediately that he was right, but I asked him anyway why he would make this suggestion. His answer was simple: "Because he's a good man, and the members of the Church don't know enough about him." </p> <p>Not knowing President Faust, but feeling a need to act on my father's suggestion, I passed the idea along to Sheri Dew, who is the vice-president of publishing at Deseret Book and a long-time friend. She, in turn, discussed it with Ron Millett, president of Deseret Book, and the two of them arranged to meet with President Faust and discuss the idea with him.</p> <p>He listened politely and said he would consider their proposal and then let them know of his decision. Having read, some months later, his journal entry for that day, I know that his initial reaction was a preference that such a book not be done. But after several weeks of discussion with his wife, family members, and a few close associates, he informed Ron and Sheri that he would agree to have a book done-but with two conditions: First, that the biography be brief; and, second,- that a selection of his teachings be included in the same volume.</p></p><p></p><h2>New Avengers, Vol. 2</h2><p>1959: under presidential orders, Nick Fury assembles the first Avengers--Victor Creed.

Moss<br><br>It is easy to take for granted the visual environment that we inhabit. Familiarity with routes of travel and places of work or leisure leads to indifference, and we fail to notice incremental changes. When a dilapidated building is eliminated by new development, it is forgotten as soon as its replacement becomes a part of our daily landscape. When an addition is grafted onto the shell of a house fallen out of fashion or function, onlookers might notice at first, but the memory of its original form is eventually lost. Also forgotten is the use a building once served. From historic homes to livestock barns, each structure holds a place in the community and can tell us as much about its citizens as their portraits and memoirs. Such is the vital yet intangible role that architecture plays in our collective memory.<br><br>Clay Lancaster (1917-2000) began during the Great Depression to document and to encourage the preservation of America's architectural patrimony. He was a pioneer of American historic preservation before the movement had a name. Although he established himself as an expert on Brooklyn brownstones and California bungalows, the nationally known architectural historian also spent four decades photographing architecture in his native Kentucky. Lancaster did not consider himself a photographer. His equipment consisted of nothing more complex than a handheld camera, and his images were only meant for his own personal use in documenting memorable and endangered structures. He had the eye of an artist, however, and recognized the importance of vernacular architecture.<br><br>The more than 150 duotone photographs in <i>Clay Lancaster's Kentucky</i> preserve the beauty of commonplace buildings as well as historic mansions and monuments. With insightful commentary by James D. Birchfield about the photographs and about Lancaster's work in Kentucky, the book documents the many buildings and architectural treasures&#x2015;both existing and long gone&#x2015;whose images and stories remain a valuable part of the state's heritage.</p><p><b>James D. Birchfield</b>, curator of rare books at the University of Kentucky, is former president of the Warwick Foundation, which promotes the Clay Lancaster legacy through education, preservation, and facilitation of cross-cultural understanding. <br><br><b>Clay Lancaster</b>, an architectural historian and native Kentuckian, was known for his work on nineteenth and twentieth-century American architecture. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Kentucky, he did post-graduate work at Columbia University, New York University, and the Asia Institute, where he established himself as an outspoken advocate of historical preservation. Also a writer and teacher, Lancaster published several books on architecture and art in addition to lecturing across the country. Lancaster returned to Kentucky in 1978 to continue his work and remained there until his death in 2000."Awarded 2nd place in Overall Excellence in the Southern Books Competition."&#x2015;<p>"Like peering into an album filled with photos of dear old relatives, this collection contains snapshots of historically significant architectural structures from around Kentucky. . . . [T]he images were beautifully restored and printed on satin-gloss paper, which adds a touch of luxury to the publication."&#x2015;<i>Lexington Herald Leader</i></p><p>"Even those less prone to nostalgia will find much to enjoy in this book . . . [which] is, at times, quite funny."&#x2015;<i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i></p><p>"Lancaster left behind a vast and important collection of his architectural field photographs.

One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

However, not one person has attempted to explain how it was forged or by whom. This book claims that this is because the diary is genuine. Feldman suggests that James Maybrick was the notorious Whitechapel Murderer, and that the largest and most detailed investigation on the subject ever to be undertaken led the author through the smokescreen of an official cover-up, via the royals and the masons, to the true provenance of the diary, Jack the Ripper&#39;s watch, and, ultimately, his identity. As well as suggesting a solution to one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of crime, this is also the story of the man possibly at its centre, James Maybrick: how he died, how his wife was falsely imprisoned for his murder, and who the real murderer of Jack the Ripper was. This story also draws in two people who are still alive today - one illegitimately descended from James Maybrick, the other from his wife, Florence.</p><p>Paul H Feldman became aware of the purported Diary of Jack the Ripper while researching for a video production in 1992.

They went back nearly two years, with casual entries of a day lived in uninteresting habit interspersed with stark dates and brief descriptions noting a nightmare of death.</p><p>The death of a girl or woman she never recognized, virtually all of them taking place in a dark, featureless room. Not a room she recognized, and yet she was absolutely certain it was somewhere in this area, in or near town. Near home. She didn&#x2019;t know why she was so sure, but the knowledge was as absolute as the awareness of her own heart beating.</p><p>In less than two years, she had dreamed about a dozen girls and women dying. Dying violently.</p><p>Emma didn&#x2019;t need the first diary entry to tell her when the nightmares had begun. They had begun after what had seemed a simple and fairly common accident.</p><p>Her family home, now a well&#x2013;respected and popular inn known as Rayburn House, offered its visitors various means of exploring the Appalachian Mountains surrounding this little valley where the small town of Baron Hollow was situated, and one of those means was guided trail riding on horseback.</p><p>Emma didn&#x2019;t ride often; she seldom had the time. But that day she had decided on the spur of the moment to go along with a group from Rayburn House. The trail ride had gone fine, just the same as it always did. Until . . .</p><p>Afterward, she had never been able to remember what had spooked her horse, but he had shied violently, catching her off guard, and Emma had fallen. Which wouldn&#x2019;t have done much harm, probably, except that her head had struck a granite boulder.</p><p>That casual decision to go riding had cost her more than a week in the town&#x2019;s small hospital, an almost invisible scar above her right temple that was easily hidden by her dark hair, and something new in her life. The doctors had been concerned because she had been unconscious for hours. They had worried about bleeding into the brain, they&#x2019;d told her. But that hadn&#x2019;t happened. The injury, they told her, had merely bruised a section of her frontal lobe.</p><p>Not like that had sounded scary or anything. Oh, no.</p><p>The list of symptoms she&#x2019;d been warned to watch out for had been sobering, everything from difficulty concentrating or completing complex tasks she&#x2019;d found easy to do before the accident, to changes in her personality or even loss of simple movement of body parts.</p><p>Paralysis.</p><p>None of that had happened, thank God, in the two years since the accident. Nothing had changed at all.</p><p>Except for the dreams. The nightmares.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re likely simple manifestations of the violence of your injury, Emma. That&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; Dr. Benfield had told her when she had finally found the nerve to ask him about it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not uncommon after a head injury to experience in some sense a reliving of the pain and fear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it seems so real,&#x201d; she protested. &#x201c;I feel the terror, the pain. The panic.&#x201d; <i>It doesn&#x2019;t just seem real. It is real. I know it.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s what you felt when you had the accident.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but&#x2014;&#x201d; <i>I also feel them die</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you talked to Chief Maitland? Are there missing women being reported, bodies being discovered? Deaths corresponding with the nights when you dream?&#x201d; His tone had been professional, but she had fancied a note in there somewhere of a doctor humoring his patient.</p><p>&#x201c;No, nothing like that,&#x201d; Emma answered reluctantly. &#x201c;I mentioned it to Dan after that girl went missing last summer, even checked on the Internet <i>and</i> back issues of the newspaper at the library, and other than her, there really hasn&#x2019;t been anything in the county. No reports of other missing girls or women who didn&#x2019;t turn up later somewhere. Anyway, I don&#x2019;t think I dreamed about that particular girl; there was a picture supplied by her boyfriend for the search parties. And he was probably right that she just hiked out of the mountains and caught a ride with someone after they argued. I heard later that was the case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then your dreams aren&#x2019;t about real girls and women being horribly tortured and killed. Right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll probably go away on their own, Emma. But if they don&#x2019;t, or if you start having real trouble sleeping, let me know. There are meds that can help.&#x201d;</p><p>That had been a few months before, when she had talked to Dr. Benfield. She hadn&#x2019;t returned.</p><p>Even though the dreams hadn&#x2019;t stopped.</p><p>Emma stared down at the journal for a long time, then closed it, her hand absently smoothing the leather surface. She wasn&#x2019;t sure which frightened her more&#x2014;the possibility that her nightmares were just her still&#x2013;injured brain on some kind of memory loop, replaying a potentially life&#x2013;threatening accident again and again but giving the women in that terrifying little play different faces and torments, or that they were warnings to her that awful things really were happening in this small, tight&#x2013;knit town nestled in the mountains of Western North Carolina.</p><p>Bad things.</p><p>Things nobody else seemed to be aware of.</p><p>Haven</p><p><br>June 25</p><p>&#x201c;You know I usually don&#x2019;t ask,&#x201d; John Garrett said to his wife, Maggie, &#x201c;but are you sure this is a good idea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Jessie needs something we can&#x2019;t give her, and whatever it is, it&#x2019;s interfering with her ability to work.

It contained plenty of casual seating, numerous worktables and computer stations, and a huge rock fireplace surrounded by the sort of sofa you could curl up on for a discussion, to read a book, or just to take an afternoon nap.

For some it was most certainly, between assignments, a family atmosphere, and even those not yet quite sure where they belonged admitted to feeling a comforting sense of community here at Haven.</p><p>For most of them, it was the first time in their lives they weren&#x2019;t made to feel like freaks, and were able to relax living and working with others who also coped with both the highs and the lows of being &#x201c;blessed&#x201d; with special abilities.</p><p>At any given time, Haven could house as many as two dozen of their operatives.

And I do mean solid. I can read more from her face about what she&#x2019;s feeling than anything empathically. She consented to having one of the telepaths try to get through again yesterday. He got nothing but a nosebleed for his trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>John frowned. &#x201c;Maybe she didn&#x2019;t want him to get through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If so, either it&#x2019;s totally unconscious or else she&#x2019;s a hell of an actress, because she fooled me.&#x201d; Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;Look, we knew from the beginning there was a trauma somewhere in her past, something buried deep. At first, she was so shut down there was no sense even in trying to get at it. And she could function, as a telepath and as a medium, so there was time to let her settle in, find her footing. Get used to the work. There was always a chance that would help. We both know it does sometimes.&#x201d;</p><p>John rested a hip on the corner of a desk and watched his wife sit down in the chair. They were, in this rare moment, alone in the room. &#x201c;Well, you handle the operatives, but my impression was that you were being very careful with her in the work. Partnering her with operatives who had a lot more experience and who&#x2019;re a lot more . . . grounded.&#x201d;</p><p>With a slight grimace, her golden eyes amused, Maggie said, &#x201c;You noticed that, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. And I&#x2019;m guessing she did too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unfortunately. Jessie is . . . stubborn. And proud. And she doesn&#x2019;t like to feel she&#x2019;s being coddled or in any way treated differently from the other operatives. So she came to me a few weeks ago and said she wanted to break through whatever was causing her abilities to be increasingly erratic. Causing the nightmares she could never remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to, or was ready to?&#x201d; John wasn&#x2019;t psychic himself, but he had worked with psychics long enough to understand them better than most.</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to. I&#x2019;m not at all sure she was or is ready to, subconsciously. But . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you tried. And none of the usual tools worked.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;Once you rule out hypnosis, there really aren&#x2019;t that many quick ways to get at something in the human mind when the mind resists. A cognitive interview didn&#x2019;t work, because I didn&#x2019;t know where to start. Starting from when Jessie left Baron Hollow fifteen years ago was useless; she only remembered getting in her car and leaving, with the overwhelming sense that she had to go as soon as possible. And, like I said, another telepath didn&#x2019;t work. None of the psychological tests have given us anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you call Bishop?&#x201d;</p><p>Unit Chief and Special Agent Noah Bishop was the third person responsible for the creation of Haven; his own Special Crimes Unit of the FBI was a team made up of psychics, and his idea that such abilities could be useful as investigative tools had proven over recent years to be successful beyond even his hopes.</p><p>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And . . . he was typically Bishop. He said Jessie would know if it was time to go back to the beginning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning back to Baron Hollow.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie nodded. &#x201c;Interestingly enough, Jessie walked in not ten minutes later asking if she could take her accumulated leave time and go back home for a visit.&#x201d;</p><p>John sighed. &#x201c;So . . . did he just know she&#x2019;d ask? Or does he know what fate has in store for her there?&#x201d; One of Bishop&#x2019;s several psychic abilities was precognition.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Maggie paused, then added, &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s packing to go back home. And even though I can&#x2019;t read her, I know damned well she&#x2019;s scared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess she wouldn&#x2019;t stand for it if we sent someone with her.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t really a question.</p><p>It was Maggie&#x2019;s turn to sigh. &#x201c;No. Her guard&#x2019;s always up with a partner, and there&#x2019;s no good way for me to send another operative otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>John eyed his wife of several years. &#x201c;Uh&#x2013;huh. What is it you <i>aren&#x2019;t </i>telling me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just . . . a bad feeling.&#x201d;</p><p>Having learned through hard experience to respect his wife&#x2019;s emotions and intuitions, John&#x2019;s only question was, &#x201c;About Jessie? About her going home?&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie hesitated, frowning, then said, &#x201c;We have half a dozen operatives out in the field right now and three here who&#x2019;re going through difficult times emotionally and psychically; any of that could be responsible. I don&#x2019;t know what it is I&#x2019;m picking up on. Or who it&#x2019;s coming from.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So maybe not Jessie and her demons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then all you can do,&#x201d; her husband reminded her, &#x201c;is warn Jessie to be careful and to check in while she&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;I just hope that&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;</p><p><br>June 27</p><p>&#x201c;This is such a bad idea.&#x201d;</p><p>Jessie Rayburn pulled her car over to the side of the road and put it into park just at the top of the hill in front of the First Baptist Church. It was a spot always considered to be the start of downtown, a spot where most of downtown was visible.</p><p>She rested her forearms on the steering wheel, gazing down on Main Street, Baron Hollow, North Carolina. Almost picture&#x2013;postcard perfect, a small town nestled in a valley of the Appalachian Mountains, a place where just about everybody knew everybody else. The locals, at least. Tourists were another matter entirely, passing through pretty much year&#x2013;round with their cameras and curiosity, leaving no mark of their visit behind.</p><p>Jessie had done a quick Web check before setting out, curious to find out if there had been any important changes in the town she&#x2019;d left behind.</p><p>With no major industry to support its work force, Baron Hollow&#x2019;s economic strength was its beautiful scenery and the charm of a small town where numerous shops and galleries offered locally created art and textiles and crafts, much of it renowned throughout the Southeast for its beauty and value. Mountain craftsmanship.</p><p>Well, all that and the reputed hauntings in various local areas, since ghost &#x201c;hunting&#x201d; had become so very popular in recent years. Baron Hollow had a long history of violence and odd events despite its peaceful, pretty appearance, which made it a prime location for paranormal researchers.

But his quiet routines are shattered one morning when he comes upon a Norwegian tourist brutally murdered near a stone cross on the shore of Lake Superior.

Love.</p><p>FBI agent Bob Lecuyer is assigned to the case, as is Norwegian detective Eirik Nyland, who is immediately flown in from Oslo. As the investigation progresses, Lance begins to make shocking discoveries&#x2014;including one that involves the murder of an Ojibwe man on the very same site more than one hundred years ago.

She'd eluded his huge paw, jumped to the side of the unconscious human lying facedown on the ground, his blood mingling with the wet grass. The female crouched again, ready to spring and prepared to fight for the human. He didn't doubt he could take her, but the set of her powerful shoulders and the gleam of the moonlight off her bared canines made him think twice. He'd seen this particular female before, often out in the jungle. None of the other males ever approached her. Perhaps she was a formidable foe?</p><p>But he wasn't just another male. He was a prime of his species, a jaguar, a fully grown <i>panthera onca</i> who always got what he wanted. He decided he wanted her.</p><p>She thought he was after the body she guarded. Good, let her. He would back off for now, taking the opportunity she'd unknowingly given him to watch her closely and see just what kind of female he was dealing with. But he had no doubt that in the end, she would find herself underneath him while he thrust with powerful strokes into her body. Oh yes, she would yield. He would see to it. And perhaps afterward, he would keep her.</p><p>Uhhnnn, owww. Aaron was sure someone had split his head open and used a metal baseball bat to work sand into the wound. And those voices! God, why wouldn't they just shut up? The buzz overlaying the words of whoever needed to shut up drilled through his brain.</p><p>Each breath sucked into his lungs felt shallow, as if he couldn't drag in enough air, and every breath out left behind a tight burning sensation. Why couldn't he take a deep breath and hold it? Pain this intense could only mean one thing -- he was dying.</p><p>The voices were louder now. Damn it. Ready to glare at the people talking when his head pounded like a drum at a rock concert, he was somewhat surprised at the gritty feel behind his lids as he forced them open. He blinked then blinked again, but the blurry images wouldn't clear. They just moved back and forth in the dimly lit room. The sound of a million cawing birds filled his ears, and the sweet scent of wet grass floated on a cooling breeze across his skin. His <i>bare</i> skin. Did they have bare skin in the hereafter?</p><p>He blinked a few more times, wincing as the side of his head exploded with a new round of pain. And who was the bearded old man leaning close to his face? He wanted to lift his hand to smack the man and tell him to back up a bit. The garlic on his breath made Aaron's stomach lurch but the pounding in his head was so fierce, just the thought of blowing chunks made him grit his teeth to hold back the bile while the vein in his forehead threatened to burst. The old man was speaking. What? Sounded something like mud, or blood, or...he just couldn't make it out, his thoughts were too scrambled. Oblivion had been pretty sweet compared to this. Perhaps he could slip back into it?</p><p>But not before he caught a glimpse of the angel standing just behind the garlicky old man. Now he remembered, sort of. Lightning. His plane had gone down in the jungle after the engine under the left wing caught fire. The image was blurry but he knew an angel when he saw one. Was she here to take him to heaven? He was sure he'd done at least a few good deeds to warrant making it through the pearly gates.</p><p>This angel had milk chocolate skin and a set of piercing, almond-shaped, light gray eyes that made his pulse skip a beat or two. And her hair, a shoulder-length mane any woman would kill for. Thick and curly, it hit her shoulders at the perfect length and made his fingers want to reach out and touch the silky black-as-sin tresses before he floated away to the hereafter. The image of his angel wavered.</p><p>"Wait! Come back, beautiful! Can't we spend some time? Maybe talk awhile before I leave this plane?" Could she hear his urgent whispers? Of course she could, all supernatural beings had great hearing. So why didn't she respond? Instead, she just looked at him with a strange mix of pity and irritation. What the hell kind of angel was she anyway? She was supposed to be smiling at him, preparing him for his journey. Well, she obviously wasn't interested in doing her job. Maybe if he lodged a formal complaint with God, she'd get fired.</p><p>The garlic master was back. His stomach lurched. <i>Damn it, old man</i>, he shouted in his head, and immediately regretted the ferocity of his thoughts. Now his neck, shoulders and ribs joined his head, pounding relentlessly against his skin from the inside out.</p><p>The older man stuck him on the top of his hand with something and the beauty faded away fast, but not before he got a good glimpse of the swell of the angel's breasts and the curve of her shoulders. Since when did cherubs wear tank tops? It sure looked good on her. And how could he be in so much pain and still manage to achieve a hard-on? Damn, she's sexy, he smirked at himself as his eyelids fluttered closed. Hell, even in his state of impending death, he was thinking with his cock instead of his brain.</p><p><i>I'm no better than the half-assed angel</i>, he thought as sleep claimed him.</p><p>Reya followed Dr. Matons out of her bedroom and closed the door with a quiet snap. After brewing herself a cup of tea, she joined her old friend out on the screened veranda and plopped down in her favorite plastic patio chair. The smell of the passing storm was heavy in the air, along with the scent of charred wood and jet fuel. In spite of the evening's hair-raising events, she was calm and determined.</p><p>Vanilla and clove scented smoke floated up from Dr. Matons's pipe. She should have never asked her aunt Sulu to send the stuff. Now the old curmudgeon would never again settle for the local tobaccos.</p><p>"Well, our little patient was lucky tonight," Dr. Matons drawled around his pipe.</p><p>"<i>Little</i> patient?" Reya queried with amusement. She was sure she'd never met a man so long his feet practically hung off the edge of her bed, or a more muscularly perfect specimen as the one lying in her bedroom. She and Dr. Matons had spent the past several hours removing glass and plastic from various patches of skin. They'd stitched the deeper cuts across his back, wrapped his chest tightly and cleaned off all the blood. She'd seen every inch of his magnificent body and there was nothing, and she meant <i>nothing</i>, little about him.</p><p>"It's a good thing you were out on patrol when his plane went down. I don't know if he would have made it otherwise," the doctor said, blowing out a ring of thick smoke. "He is certainly handsome, as men go." His eyes crinkled at the sides as he watched her. The old matchmaker. Always looking for someone to pair her up with. Even an unconscious man in serious condition.</p><p>When she didn't answer but stared out into the night, he continued. "I gave him a strong painkiller, but he's not out of the woods. Do you mind if I sleep here so I can check on him during the night?"</p><p>"No, I don't mind at all. Why don't you take the office? The futon in there is pretty comfy. I'll take the couch." Her eyes hadn't strayed from the tangle of ferns and vines leading into the dark canopy of jungle no more than a hundred yards from her back stairs.</p><p>"You're not planning on going back out in this deluge, are you?"</p><p>"The storm is almost past. I'll be fine. Besides, something weird happened out there tonight. If you're still awake when I get back, I'll tell you about it."</p><p>The moon, pale and obscured by dark thunderheads, was the only light shining onto her second-story veranda. Reya unlaced her boots, toed them off and set them beside the screen door that led down the back stairs. Dr. Matons continued to puff on his pipe while she peeled off her tank top and blood-spattered pants, tossed them in a pile and loosely tied a small bundle around her neck.</p><p>"Be careful, my dear. Wake me when you return," Dr. Matons called quietly. Extinguishing his pipe, he rose and slipped through the sliding-glass door and into her living room.</p><p>Reya watched his retreating back until the subtle snap of the office door told her she was alone. Shirt, pants and shoes in a neat pile on the floor, she dropped to her knees. Muscles rippled and bunched as raw power surged through her limbs -- heady, thunderous power as her body shortened then stretched. Her tall frame shuddered as thick fur burst through her pores, replacing smooth skin. The cooling breeze ruffled the sleek fur on the tufts of the ears of a black jaguar as she stalked down the stairs and loped into the surrounding jungle.</p><p>Copyright 2009 by Ellora's Cave Publishing, Inc.Jaguar's Rule copyright 2006 by T.

But there are still those who aspire to what the country used to stand for: freedom for all.In the Western American Territories, Chinese American Ren Cabot has lost nearly everything to Imperial Japan&#39;s rule. After the public execution of his mom for treason five years ago, Ren lives under constant scrutiny of the Empire, afraid that one wrong step will rip apart what remains of his family for good. However, when a chance encounter with a resistance group offers Ren an opportunity to save lives and quite possibly topple the government, he agrees to their deadly plot. But his role will lead him straight into the heart of the enemy, and if caught, death would be a much better fate than what the Empire will do to him . . .</p><p>Caroline Tung Richmond is the author of <i>The Only Thing to Fear</i> and <i>The Darkest Hour</i>, as well as a freelancer writer. <br><br> A self-proclaimed history nerd and cookie connoisseur, Caroline lives in Virginia with her family and her dog, Otto von Bismarck&#x2015;named for the German chancellor (naturally).<br><br>Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;The Allied powers have lost World War II. The United States, now sliced into pieces held by Japan, Italy, and Germany exists under strictly enforced racial and social hierarchies. The story is set in the Japanese-controlled Western American Territories, where ruling monarch Crown Prince Katsura uses threats of being sent to jail, re-education centers (housed in the former Japanese concentration camps), or execution by the Imperial Army's Ronin Elite to keep the populace under control. The Ronin Elite are "anomalies" possessing a gene enabling them to kill with a look or a touch. Despite this, a resistance movement is growing bolder and the frustrated Crown Prince is becoming increasingly repressive. Ren Tsai, son of a white American man, was forced to watch the execution of his Chinese American mother for treason. He secretly took up her work and became a resistance propagandist known as The Viper. Circumstances force Ren to come forward and assist in a daring plot which will dramatically increase the rebel movement's strength. The straightforward narrative has few twists, and characters are developed just well enough to tell the story. Social issues have as much weight here as the historical elements. The simplicity of the story works in the book's favor; potentially challenging material is accessible to middle grade readers, but there is enough action to hook older ones. VERDICT This is a good introduction to historical reimagining for middle grades; all readers will be engaged with the handling of social issues as well as revelations about the secret pockets of resistors, their plots, and their battles with authorities.&#x2014;Carla Riemer, Claremont Middle School, Oakland</p><h2>Modesty Blaise: The Gabriel Set-Up</h2><p>Modesty Blaise, cult creation of best-selling author Peter O&#x2019;Donnell, is back!

Maughan's book bridges the gaps between religious, cultural, and imperial history to give a full picture of the movement's importance.<br><br>Maughan explores Anglicanism as a microcosm of the larger religious culture of Britain, particularly in light of the expanding British empire.

Mr. Mu�oz lives in Hamilton, Montana.Grade 4-6 Young readers won't roam far from Buffalo, for Patent's book is attractive, accurate and clearly written. As the buffalo is followed through the seasons in Yellowstone National Park and the National Bison Range in Montana, Patent discusses both the habits and behavior of this historically important animal and the careful management needed to maintain it in its current artificial environment. The lucid, well-written text is further enhanced by many black-and-white photographs, including an exciting sequence depicting two bulls fighting. A good complement to this contemporary study of the bison is Jack Denton Scott's Return of the Buffalo (Putnam, 1976; o.p.) which tells more of the bison's history and importance to the American Indian. Patent's book will make a useful addition to any library collection not only as a behavioral study of the American bison but as a success story in wildlife management and the return of an endangered species.

This is a story about friendship, dreams, and gowing up. On the top floor of a lovely old Parisian apartment building in the Avenue des Temps Perdus lives the slightly odd Mademoiselle Oiseau. No one knows exactly how old she is. In fact, since she never leaves her house, nobody really knows her at all. Sometimes, though, one can catch a glimpse of this elegant lady with her unkempt curls and endlessly long pearl necklaces when she&#39;s out on her terrace amid her countless cats and birds. Isabella is a 9-year-old girl who lives in the apartment under Mademoiselle oiseau&#39;s. She is so unremarkable that she&#39;s practically invisible. One day, when Isabella comes home from school and gets in the elevator, she accidentally presses the number for the sixth floor rather than the fifth. She doesn&#39;t even realize her mistake until she sticks her key into the lock and Mademoiselle Oiseau opens the door. When Isabella and Mademoiselle Oiseau meet, a wonderful friendship begins. They spend their days together exploring Mademoiselle Oiseau&#39;s roof garden, creating fashion shows with silk dresses and high-heeled shoes, or--to the amazement of everyone--making it snow on a spring day. Soon, Isabella has become a much braver, more confident girl.</p><p>The Story of Mademoiselle Oiseau keeps alive a sense of wonder while pondering the nature of friendship, dreams and growing up...

Puffin Modern Classics are relaunched under a new logo: A Puffin Book. There are 20 titles to collect in the series, listed below, all with exciting new covers and fun-filled endnotes. THE FAMILY FROM ONE END STREET by Eve Garnett is the story of everyday life in the big, happy Ruggles family who live in the small town of Otwell. Father is a dustman and Mother a washerwoman. Then there&#39;s all the children - practical Lily Rose, clever Kate, mischievous twins James and John, followed by Jo, who loves films, little Peg and finally baby William. A truly classic book awarded the Carnegie Medal as the best children&#39;s book of 1937. Eve Garnett was born in 1900 in Worcestershire, and studied art at Chelsea Polytechnic and the Royal Academy School of Art. Whilst a student, she sketched the people of the East End slums and was haunted by the poverty she had witnessed, resolving to do something to bring the plight of the working-class family to people&#39;s attention. The Family from One End Street was originally published by Frederick Muller in 1937, followed by The Further Adventures of the Family from One End Street in 1956, and Holiday at Dew Drop Inn in 1962.

A pioneer of great children&#39;s literature, Ruth Krausspublished more than thirty books for children during a career that spanned forty years. Krauss and Sendak collaborated on eight books, and we are delighted to reintroduce four of these gems in brand-new editions, together with a favorite Maurice Sendak picture book.</p><p>Ruth Krauss, a member of the experimental Writer&#39;s Laboratory at the Bank Street School in New York City in the 1940s, imaginatively used humor and invented words to create some of the very first books for children that highlighted the child s inner life.She collaborated with some of the greatest illustrators in children s literature, including her husband, Crockett Johnson.Now in its second season, HarperCollins's reissue of 22 Sendak classics continues. This time, his collaborations with Ruth Krauss take center stage. In Charlotte and the White Horse, first published in 1955, creamy pages frame Sendak's softly lit illustrations of a girl who convinces her father to keep a wobbly legged horse and cares for him until he can stand on his own. Sendak's delicate watercolors suit the dream-like mood of a boy who accomplishes all that he sets out to do in his imaginary world, in I Want to Paint My Bathroom Blue (1956), also by Krauss. A boy's imagination also comes to the fore in A Very Special House (1953) by Krauss, as the artist depicts the hero creating a home filled with a turtle, a giant, a very old lion and "some monkeys and some skunkeys." Oversize pages brim with the creatures as well as his house's "very special" furnishings. Open House for Butterflies (1960) takes a similar format to these collaborators' classic A Hole Is to Dig, and lastly, Hector Protector and As I Went Over the Water: Two Nursery Rhymes (1965) by Sendak conveys as much plot through the artist's wordless spreads as with the minimal text. For collectors and budding readers alike.

He was the first to warn of a coming "clash of civilizations," a term he coined in 1957, and has led an amazing life, as much a political actor as a scholar of the Middle East. In this witty memoir he reflects on the events that have transformed the region since World War II, up through the Arab Spring.</p><p>A pathbreaking scholar with command of a dozen languages, Lewis has advised American presidents and dined with politicians from the shah of Iran to the pope. Over the years, he had tea at Buckingham Palace, befriended Golda Meir, and briefed politicians from Ted Kennedy to Dick Cheney. No stranger to controversy, he pulls no punches in his blunt criticism of those who see him as the intellectual progenitor of the Iraq war. Like America&#x2019;s other great historian-statesmen Arthur Schlesinger and Henry Kissinger, he is a figure of towering intellect and a world-class raconteur, which makes <i>Notes on a Century</i> essential reading for anyone who cares about the fate of the Middle East.</p></p><p>Bernard Lewis is the Cleveland E.

He has evinced not only an unswerving commitment to historical truth and a hatred of what he calls &#x2018;the falsification of history&#x2019; but also a passionate, at times obsessive, curiosity about other peoples, other places. . . . No matter how recondite or exotic his subject matter, he writes incisively and with unobtrusive elegance.&#x201d;<p>&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lewis has led a staggeringly productive life&#x2014;publishing a jaw-dropping 32 books&#x2014;and seems to have had more fun than any department worth of more somber professors. . . . We are fortunate to have this chatty memoir of reminiscences of scholarly discovery and stimulating encounters with everyone from Isaac Stern to Scoop Jackson to the shah of Iran.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Few could produce a book as witty, erudite and humorous as this engaging autobiography, which, alongside these lighter characteristics, is also packed with learning and wisdom. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the distillation of a long, attentive and productive life as a scholar and engaged intellectual. . . . We did not need this book to tell us how impressive an intellect&nbsp;Mr. Lewis has or what a superbly informed historian he is, but it reminds us nonetheless of all this. As it does of what a charming and attractive personality he has been graced with, enabling him to draw attention so easily to what he has to impart.&#x201d;<p>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Times</i></p><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thoughtful, outspoken words from a sage who has lived his share of history . . . In episodic, wittily composed chapters, Lewis addresses salient events in his career as a historian of the Near and Middle East. . . . He writes frankly of his long tenure at Princeton, the dicey Israel-Palestinian crisis, and the eclipse of secularism in the Muslim world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lewis looks back at his achievements as a founder of the discipline of Islamic history, a prodigious scholar and writer, and a tireless traveler who forged relationships with scholars and government leaders all over the world. . . . Here, he conveys the intellectual curiosity and power that has enabled him to transmit to both academics and general readers an understanding of the development of Islam as a faith and a culture along with the rise and decline of Islamic political power. With scholarly rigor and graceful, witty prose, he also offers insights about the nature of history, cultural identity, and literary values. This memoir by an intellectual committed to a relentless search for historical understanding of a complex society is highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A much-needed corrective . . . Lewis&#x2019; understanding reflects more than the usual journalism or scholarship.

It became separate from Judaism at a very early date. The Roman Christians were the first to suffer savage persecution at the hands of Nero. Rome saw the greatest theological movements of the second century thrashing out the core doctrines of the Christian faith. </p><p>The emergence of the papacy and the building of the catacombs gave the Roman Church extraordinary influence and prestige in the third century, another time of cruel persecution.

Edgar Hoover</h2><p>Contrasts the law enforcement achievements of America&#39;s one-time most powerful lawman with the hidden secrets of Hoover&#39;s private life, which included a series of sexual indiscretions, criminal behavior, and a long-time alliance with the Mafia.</p><p>Hack has been an investigative writer for 20 years, covering Hollywood and the media for much of that time. He frequently appears on television as a commentator.As in his smart biographies of Howard Hughes (<i>Hughes</i>) and Ted Turner/Rupert Murdoch (<i>Clash of the Titans</i>), Hack brings a novelist's flair for drama and a journalist's nose for truth to the life of another controversial figure. With unsourced renditions of Hoover's and others' internal monologues, Hack creates some transparency for the legendary FBI chief's tantalizingly opaque psyche. His most controversial conclusion about Hoover's private life is that, despite his weird intimacy with sidekick Clyde Tolson and his household collections of male nudes and Chinese ceramics, Hoover was not gay. Rather, he was dependent for sexual excitement on furtive perusal of smut from the FBI's Obscene Files and was enamored of certain Hollywood stars, named here. Hack's account of Hoover's public life, meanwhile, zings. He covers Hoover's career from his initial exploits tracking down dissidents through his headline-grabbing pursuit of Depression-era outlaws to his postwar crusade against left-wing subversion, one increasingly out of step with the country during his Vietnam-era decline. Hack's balanced but quite critical treatment details the brilliant self-promotion, which made Hoover a national hero, as well as the paranoid anticommunism, the secret files on presidents and pinkos alike, the illegal surveillance and wiretaps and the racist antagonism to the Civil Rights movement that later made him a villain in many eyes. Hack says too little about the FBI as an institution or its crime-fighting methods, treating it mainly as an extension of Hoover's personal and political agenda. But he does offer a live-wire biography of a determined, energetic, lonely and insecure man who comes off here as much a puppet as master, a consummate bureaucratic infighter all too pathetically aware of his vulnerability to shifts in political power. 6 pages of b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Life is harder than we expect, and even the Lord Jesus, the Prince of Peace Himself, admitted, &#34;Each day has enough trouble of its own&#34; (Matthew 6:34). He said, &#34;In this world you will have trouble&#34; (John 16:33). On one occasion, He even said, &#34;Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say&#34; (John 12:27). Our souls are easily troubled. The world and its trials seem to only increase. In nearly forty years of pastoral counseling, Rob Morgan has seen a lot of changes in our culture. People are anxious, and everyone seems increasingly tense and taunt. We&#39;re overextended, running on empty, and often running late. We&#39;re worried and we&#39;re weary. One moment we&#39;re alarmed about global politics and the next we&#39;re frustrated with a clogged commode or a cranky boss. Stress can have a way of keeping us on pins and needles from dawn to darkness. In this book Pastor Morgan leads the way through the investigation of the Bible&#39;s premier passage on the subject of anxiety. Philippians 4:4-9 is God&#39;s most definitive word about overcoming anxiety and experiencing His overwhelming peace. Dissecting the following eight practices this vital passage promotes will help you to wage war on worry: The Practice of Rejoicing The Practice of Gentleness The Practice of Nearness The Practice of Prayer The Practice of Thanksgiving The Practice of Thinking The Practice of Discipleship The Practice of Peace When we study and employ these practices effectively, we have the power to erase anxious thoughts and compose our minds with peace in any situation.</p><p><p>Robert J.

Fraser paints a vivid picture of a vanished interwar world.

When she was formed and fought her early wars of existence, most Bible-believing Christians believed there was a real connection with what was going on in the Middle East and Bible prophecy that predicts an end-time return of the Jews to their land. While support for Israel remains high in most evangelical communities, we are seeing the beginning of a decline, especially among younger evangelicals, who question whether modern Israel really relates to end-time Bible prophecy. <p> </p><p> <i>The Case for Zionism</i> attempts to bring together biblical, historical, and legal arguments for the legitimacy of the startup nation known as Israel as it: </p><ul> <li>Explains controversies such as antisemitism and Replacement Theology</li> <li>Details the biblical and legal rights of Modern Israel</li> <li>Explores the prophetic nature and future of Israel.</li> </ul> <p> </p><p> In this presentation, Thomas Ice answers many of the contemporary arguments being used by both secular and religious communities to undermine what he believes is the hand of God at work in our own day.</p></p><p>THOMAS ICE is Executive Director of The <em>Pre-Trib Research Center</em> in Justin, Texas, which he founded in 1994 with Dr. Tim LaHaye to research, teach, and defend the pretribulational rapture and related Bible prophecy doctrines.

Harlan Ellison is the most honored fantasist of the 20th century, and many of the books in the long-awaited series have been out of print for decades. Each volume also contains new introductions, and often the original work itself has been revised or expanded by the author. <i>Edgeworks 2</i> includes an early (1961) novel <i>Spider Kiss</i>, originally titled <i>Rockabilly</i>. It was one of the very first--and still remains one of the best--dissections of the wildly destructive rock &amp; roll lifestyle. <i>Stalking the Nightmare</i> is a 1982 collection of assorted short stories and essays, which also boasts an insightful foreword by Ellison admirer Stephen King.

(Mister Rogers' First Experiences Bks.). CIP. Putnam. 1988. PLB $12.95; pap. $5.95. PreSchool-Grade 2 In his usual tone of sympathetic understanding and gentle reassurance, Mr. Rogers discusses the common childhood traumas of hospitalization and grief over the loss of a pet. Large, clear color photographs support the texts. Going to the Hospital follows two appealing preschool age children, a pigtailed black girl and red-headed white boy, as they experience the preliminary procedures of getting an identification bracelet, being examined with various instruments, having blood drawn, and talking with a nurse and doctor, while comforting but straightforward explanations for the procedures are given. Since most of the pictures are posed, no one looks frightened or in pain. No details of surgery or postoperative recovery are shown. The Hospital Book (Crown, 1981) by James Howe is more comprehensive and realistic, but with its black-and-white photographs of actual hospitalized children and longer text, it is better suited to older children more able to absorb the complicated and sometimes disturbing information. Sara Stein's A Hospital Story (Walker, 1984) follows a little girl's tonsillectomy well but is more limited. All of these books have helpful information directed to parents. When a Pet Dies portrays a Hispanic family whose dog dies and a white family whose cat dies. The animals are not shown suffering. The grieving children are posed as feeling sad and angry, being comforted by their parents, asking questions about death, conducting a pet funeral, and finally adjusting to the loss. In the text the theme is delicately expanded to embrace all sorrow and the happy fact that the love, once shared, lives on. Again, although there is other good literature in this field such as The Tenth Good Thing About Barney (Atheneum, 1971) by Judith Viorst, Jim's Dog Muffins (Greenwillow, 1984) by Miriam Cohen, and It Must Hurt a Lot (Multnomah, 1985) by Doris Sanford, this nonfiction book is more explicit and specific. The format and typography are clear and attractive, the language and concepts simple but sound psychologically, and the material geared either for an adult to share or for children to read alone.

You hear a lot of twaddle about how baseball unites generations, but as with most cliches, there is a resonant truth in there somewhere, if only the speaker or writer or illustrator has the talent to reinvent it.<p>Hall and Moser have the talent to do just that. There is nothing remarkable about this story: a 12-year-old New Hampshire farm boy and his father, both avid baseball fans, are herding their geese across a country road one day when a slick roadster swerves to avoid the animals and winds up in the ditch. Yes, the driver of the roadster just happens to be Babe Ruth, star pitcher of the Boston Red Sox and young Willard's favorite player. The Babe gives Willard a baseball glove, and the family myth is begun. Years of Babe worship follow, extending even beyond the unfathomable trade of Ruth to the hated Yankees and encompassing a new generation, in the form of Willard's daughter, Ruthie (that's right, named after the Babe). What lifts all this beyond twaddle is Hall's ear and Moser's eye for detail. We feel and see the way the world was then--before television, before cyberspace--when the rhythm of the seasons had tangible meaning and when baseball talk was a good way to get through the harsh New England winter.

Modern-art historian Meyer Schapiro recognizes this when he states that "what is most important is that van Gogh converted all this aspiration and anguish into his art, which thus became the first example of a truly personal art, art as a deeply lived means of spiritual deliverance or transformation of the self...." What naturally follows from Schapiro is not only a synopsis of van Gogh's artistic career and personal travails, but also an insightful analysis of van Gogh's technique and handling of paint, and how they manipulate the viewer's emotional response to his paintings. With a sympathetic yet penetrating essay by Schapiro, this book is a pleasure to read for van Gogh enthusiasts of any level. The more expert art historian might prefer van Gogh's drawings, of which approximately 20 are reproduced here in black and white. It is for his paintings, however, that one admires van Gogh, and this book's 49 full-page color plates with accompanying comments by Schapiro are its strength. <i>Van Gogh</i> contains works from no less than 30 different worldwide collections to better represent all phases of the artist's development, and includes his most famous and best-loved works.Francesca Castria is an expert on nineteenth- and twentieth -century art and has collaborated with Stefano Zuffi on both <i>Art in Venice</i> and <i>Italian Painting.</i></p><h2>The Idea of Communism 3: The Seoul Conference</h2><p><b>An all-star cast of radical intellectuals discuss the continued importance of communist principles</b><br><br>In 2009 Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek brought together an acclaimed group of intellectuals to discuss the continued relevance of communism.

In <i>Client State</i>, Gavan McCormack examines the current transformation of Japan, designed to meet the demands from Washington that Japan become the &#x201c;Great Britain of the Far East.&#x201d; Exploring postwar Japan&#x2019;s relationship with America, he contends that US pressure has been steadily applied to bring Japan in line with neoliberal principles. The Bush administration&#x2019;s insistence on Japan&#x2019;s thorough subordination has reached new levels, and is an agenda heavily in the American, rather than the Japanese, national interest. It includes comprehensive institutional reform, a thorough revamp of the security and defense relationship with the US, and&#x2014;alarmingly&#x2014;vigorous pursuit of Japan&#x2019;s acquisition of nuclear weapons.</p><p><b>Gavan McCormack</b> is Emeritus Professor in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University, Canberra.

This second go-round, which includes nine new tales, cements his reputation in the horror genre by once again yanking young readers out of their safe, familiar world. As in the previous collection, the prose remains plain, and the stories are fashioned around the ordinary: a cell phone, an elevator, a trip on an airplane.

The last story is more puzzle than literary construct, but it's tantalizing enough to convince even jaded readers to work out the devilish message spelled out in the text.

When the Nazis occupied Holland the family was forced to flee again, because they were Jews. They remained in Amsterdam, hiding in the abandoned half of an old office building, along with another family. Anne was thirteen years old at this time. In her diary Anne reveals the relations between eight people living under extraordinary conditions, facing hunger, the ever present threat of discovery and death, boredom, petty misunderstandings. Anne&#39;s account of their daily lives is a fascinating commentary on human behavior. Here is the compelling self-portrait of a young girl just on the brink of maturity, when the diary and her life reach their tragic end.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>The compelling diary of a young girl on the brink of maturity as her life draws to toward its tragic end -- one of the most moving and vivid documents of the Jewish experience,</p><h2>Teaching Genius: Dorothy DeLay and the Making of a Musician</h2><p>(Amadeus). The late Dorothy DeLay taught violin at Juilliard for more than 50 years, and a list of her pupils from Itzhak Perlman and Kennedy to Midori and Sarah Chang reads like a who&#39;s who of the violin world. For more than 10 years, the author was granted access to DeLay&#39;s classes at Juilliard and the Aspen School, allowing her to craft this fascinating book that is both an exploration of the mysteries of teaching and learning and a feast of anecdotes about an extraordinary woman. HARDCOVER.</p><p>Some people are born teachers, some become great through experience, and some become famous through their students. The renowned violin teacher Dorothy DeLay fits all three categories. She discovered her innate talent and love for teaching early in life, inspired by the great pedagogue Ivan Galamian, but her long association with him, first as his student, then as his assistant at the Juilliard School, ended in an acrimonious parting of ways. She then developed her own class of students at Juilliard and other prestigious conservatories, and soon acquired a worldwide reputation as unrivalled producer of prodigies and virtuosos. One of her first star pupils was Itzhak Perlman; it might be said that they made each other famous. The music world has long speculated about what sets DeLay and her teaching apart, and in this book, 10 years in the making, Barbara Sand tries to find some answers. She observed DeLay in action and interaction with her pupils at Juilliard, the Aspen summer school, and at home, and talked extensively with DeLay and her husband of almost 60 years, Edward Newhouse. Sand interviewed her assistants, her students past and present, and the conductors and managers who engage them. What emerges is a portrait of a woman whose inexhaustible energy, determination, inquiring intellect, and single-minded commitment to her work and her students give her a larger-than-life quality. This is a personal profile, not a description of a teaching method. Indeed, DeLay claims she has none, though it seems clear that she is guided by Galamian's technical principles. However, she rejects his well-known authoritarianism, responding to her pupils' individual needs and tempering stringent demands with generous encouragement and support. What makes her approach unique is her deep involvement in her students' lives, from choosing their wardrobes to remaining available to them as adviser and confidante long after they leave her studio. Even more remarkable is her ability to launch them into the concert world. Their gratitude and devotion are unstintingly expressed by Sand's carefully selected interviewees, as is her own wholehearted admiration. The book is a hymn of praise.<p> However, like all successful people, DeLay has her share of detractors. Sand dispatches them in a single chapter, mostly devoted to refuting criticism, some of which is undoubtedly inspired by envy. It is said that her students win major prizes and make successful careers because she attracts the best talents from all over the world, and because she has attained an unprecedented position of power and influence in the music profession's slippery back corridors. She takes only highly accomplished, motivated students who are preparing for solo careers and practice all day. Even the youngest children arrive playing virtuoso concertos, which indicates heavy family pressure and means that she can hand out the carrots while the parents wield the stick. Nevertheless, the chapter on prodigies makes the tortuous process of training and "handling" them sound utterly benign and healthy.</p><p> Sand discusses DeLay's well-known habit of keeping students waiting for hours and leaving much of the teaching to her assistants (whom she gets on the Juilliard faculty), explaining that she accepts too many students and spends too much time promoting them. But she mentions legitimate pedagogical issues only by implication. Unlike teachers who also perform, DeLay never plays for her students (beyond some technical demonstration) to avoid exposing them to a single influence; instead, she advises them to listen to different interpretations on many recordings. But doesn't this also produce imitation, and perhaps confusion as well? Entirely performance-oriented, DeLay focuses on what is effective onstage and encourages a large-scaled, extroverted playing style. She speaks emphatically about teaching her students to think for themselves, but never mentions fostering their emotional response to the music or helping them in the slow, inward process of discovering their own feelings. Yet isn't this the key to becoming a communicative artist?</p><p> Sand is an empathetic, adept interviewer, winning her subjects' confidence and eliciting frank, informative responses (though some could have used editing). Galamian, perhaps to contrast his teaching style with DeLay's, generally comes off rather badly; DeLay herself speaks about their rupture candidly but without rancor. The book contains much absorbing information, punctuated with many detailed descriptions of people's looks and attire. There are sweeping statements about players and teachers. Why, for example, are such great artist-teachers as Flesch, Busch, Enescu, Rostal, and Bron not mentioned among the 20th-century "teaching geniuses"? Sand's style is a pleasure to read, engaging, lively, humorous, and to the point, despite some moments of confusion and contradiction. Her perceptive insights and warm feeling for her subject bring us closer to understanding what makes Dorothy DeLay such a fascinating, controversial personality. <i>--Edith Eisler</i></p>Almost all of todays major violinists spent their musical childhoods under the watchful eye of Dorothy DeLay. Writer Barbara L. Sand spent ten years as a "lesson junkie" in DeLays studio at the Juilliard School of Music in New York, observing and analyzing the legends styles and techniques in a quest to understand what sets DeLay apart from other teachers. What Sand discovered is difficult to quantify, so instead of making pronouncements, she presents stories and conversations gleaned from those ten years. <p>"With Miss DeLay, we could have a good discussion and we could have a good fightforget about doing that with Galamian! For example, if there was a note out of tune, he would say, 'What's the matter, it is out of tune!' Miss DeLay would say, 'Sugarplum, what is your concept of F sharp?' which means your F sharp is out of tune. It is a different style of teaching that puts the student at ease."

He studied modern languages, and later medicine, at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dublin. For many years he was assistant editor of the influential British journal Studies in Comparative Religion. He spent most of his working life in London, England, and retired to Windsor, Ontario in 1982. <p>Dr. Stoddart has made a life-long study of the great religious traditions of the world, and in this connection has traveled widely in Europe, North Africa, Turkey, India, and Ceylon. He has contributed many articles to international journals, and has translated books and articles from German and French into English. As an author he is probably best known for his short surveys of Sufism, Buddhism, and Hinduism aimed at Western readers.</p>The following excerpt is taken from the first two paragraphs of Chapter 1: <p>How to Approach Medieval and Oriental Civilizations </p><p>In order to understand a culture, it is necessary to love it, and one can only do this on the basis of the universal and timeless values that it carries within it. These values are essentially the same in all true cultures, that is to say, in cultures which meet not only the physical, but also the spiritual needs of man, without which his life has no meaning. </p><p>Nothing brings us into such immediate contact with another culture as a work of art which, within that culture, represents, as it were, a "center." This may be a sacred image, a temple, a cathedral, a mosque, or even a carpet with a primordial design. Such works invariably express an essential quality or factor, which neither an historical account, nor an analysis of social and economic conditions, can capture. A similarly rich insight into another culture can be found in its literature, especially in those works that deal with eternal verities. But such works are by definition profound and symbolical, and are mostly unintelligible to the modern reader without the aid of a detailed commentary. A work of art, on the other hand, can, without any mental effort on our part, convey to us immediately and "existentially" a particular intellectual truth or spiritual attitude, and thereby grant us all manner of insights into the nature of the culture concerned. Thus one can more readily understand the intellectual and ethical forms of a Buddhist culture if one is familiar with the Buddha-image that is typical of it; and one can much more easily form a picture of the religious and social life of the Middle Ages if one has first assimilated the architecture of a Romanesque Abbey or a Gothic cathedral&#x2014;always assuming, of course, that one is sufficiently sensitive to the forms of an authentic traditional art.</p></p><h2>A Fair-Weather Eden</h2><p>Fairweather Eden: Story of Boxgrove and the First Europeans by Mark Roberts&#39; &#39;Michael W.

It ranks with its great predecessor, <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>, as one of William James's masterworks.</p><p>The book is not concerned with institutional religion. Its subtitle is "A Study in Human Nature," and James defines his subject as the feelings, acts, and experiences of individuals in relation to what they consider to be divine. His broad topics include the religion of healthy-mindedness; the sick soul; the divided self and its unification; conversion; saintliness; and mysticism. These and other phenomena are vividly documented by individual case histories--recorded in autobiographies, diaries, confessions, and similar writings--drawn from the whole range of world literature.</p><p>Constantly reprinted over the years, <i>Varieties</i> here appears for the first time in an edition prepared and annotated according to modern standards of textual scholarship. Manuscript material has been used to recover the form in which the last two lectures were originally delivered.</p></p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>Divine Sexuality: The Joy of Tantra</h2><p><p>The erotic aspects of Tantra are taught in this sexual guide that reveals transformative insights and methods for all levels of experience.

It is also the most popular with the general public. Proof of this has been provided in recent years by blockbuster exhibitions of the works of Degas, Gauguin, van Gogh, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Monet, and by record sums realized from the sale of Impressionist paintings.</p><p>Despite its popularity and a whole host of publications&#x2015;the majority of them about the most famous names&#x2015;many areas of Impressionism are still under-researched. Many &#x201c;second-rank&#x201d; Impressionists have remained unknown or have sunk into oblivion. This monograph fills the gap, as it explores French Impressionism alongside related art movements that flourished simultaneously in the rest of Europe and in North America.</p><p>Part 1 deals with Impressionism in France, including Post- and Neo-Impressionism. As well as discussing the most renowned artists, its aim is to introduce others who are still little-known today. Among them are the long underrated Gustave Caillebotte, represented by 17 paintings, and artists such as Fr�d�ric Bazille, Marie Bracquemond, Henri-Edmond Cross, Jean-Louis Forain, Eva Gonzal�s, Armand Guillaumin, Albert Lebourg, Stanislas L�pine, Maximilien Luce, Berthe Morisot, Lucien Pissarro, Jean-Fran�ois Raffa�lli, Henri Rouart, and Victor Vignon.</p><p>The eight chapters of part 2 focus on paintings inspired by French Impressionism and produced in parallel in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Scandinavia, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, Italy, Spain, Great Britain, the USA and Canada. Rarely did painters in these countries slavishly copy the ideas emerging from France. Instead, most non-French artists found astonishingly original ways of translating them into the artistic language of their native lands.</p></p><p>Ingo F.

Said to be one of J.R.R. Tolkien's childhood favorites, <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> is the story of the young Princess Irene, her good friend Curdie--a minor's son--and Irene's mysterious and beautiful great great grandmother, who lives in a secret room at the top of the castle stairs. Filled with images of dungeons and goblins, mysterious fires, burning roses, and a thread so fine as to be invisible and yet--like prayer--strong enough to lead the Princess back home to her grandmother's arms, this is a story of Curdie's slow realization that sometimes, as the princess tells him, "you must believe without seeing." Simple enough for reading aloud to a child (as I've done myself more than once with my daughter), it's rich enough to repay endless delighted readings for the adult. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>Michael Phillips has written four dozen books, most of them novels, with sales totaling over five million copies. He also has edited George MacDonald novels for today&#39;s reader, including, The Curate of Glaston. He and his wife make their home in Eureka, California.</p><h2>The Human Security Agenda: How Middle Power Leadership Defied U.S. Hegemony</h2><p><p>Middle power states, such as Canada or Denmark, are often thought of as "followers" of great powers rather than significant actors in global security. Challenging this view, this book highlights how middle powers have in fact showed great leadership by developing a "human security" agenda that focuses on countering threats to human beings rather than to nation-states.</p><p>The work examines how coalitions of middle powers have performed through five case studies: the formation of the Multinational Standby High Readiness Brigade for United Nations Operations (SHIRBRIG), the realization of the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty, the establishment of the International Criminal Court, the regulation of the legal trade in small arms and light weapons, and the adoption of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principle. Furthermore, the book explores how the human security initiatives were shaped by the middle powers' choices of diplomatic strategy, and how they were affected by the reactions of the hegemonic United States.</p><p>The Human Security Agenda will appeal to those studying international relations and global security, as well as foreign policy and international organizations.</p></p><p><p>Ronald M.

Her childhood was spent in the centre of the Spanish reconquest and was dominated by her military hero of a father (St Ferdinand) and her prodigiously clever brother (King Alfonso X the Learned). Married at the age of twelve and a mother at thirteen, she gave birth to at least sixteen children, most of whom died young. She was a prisoner for a year amid a civil war in which her husband&#x2019;s life was in acute danger. Devoted to Edward, she accompanied him everywhere. All in all, she was to live for extended periods in five different countries.Eleanor was a highly dynamic, forceful personality who acted as part of Edward&#x2019;s innermost circle of advisers, and successfully accumulated a vast property empire for the English Crown. In cultural terms her influence in architecture and design &#x2013; and even gardening &#x2013; can be discerned to this day, while her idealised image still speaks to us from Edward&#x2019;s beautiful memorials to her, the Eleanor crosses.

This charming little book was given by Lorca to his friend Manuel Altolaguirre and his wife as a gift to their first child. <i>Ode to Walt Whitman</i>, a passionate meditation on homosexuality in a society that proscribes it, is perhaps the best-known book to have come out of the poet's New York Cycle of poems, a damning vision of urban life under capitalism. Perhaps Lorca's finest poem, <i>A Flood of Tears for Ignacio Sanchez Mojis</i>, is a moving elegy to his friend, a renowned bullfighter who was also a writer and a hero to a generation of poets. With <i>Six Galician Poems</i>, written in the Galician language, Lorca returns to themes of the simple life and folklore of the Spanish people. Published only a few months before the Spanish Civil War broke out, this book &#x2013; a classic of Galician literature &#x2013; never won the prominence it deserved.</p><p>"His real impact, however, surely comes from the stark vividness of his imagery, his ability to conjure up primal subjective realms of love and death: The guitar makes dreams weep.

In examining the inhumanity of a man for whom politics became a substitute for life, he discusses Hitler&#x2019;s bizarre relationships with women, his arrested psychological development, his ideological misconceptions, his growing obsession with racial extermination, and the murderous rages of his distorted mind. Finally, Haffner confronts the most disturbing question of all: Could another Hitler rise to power in modern Germany?</p></p><p>Ewald Osers is the distinguished translator of numerous works of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction from German and Czech, including the correspondence of Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam (NYU Studies in NE Civilization)</h2><p><p><b>A History of Arabic Astronomy</b> is a comprehensive survey of Arabic planetary theories from the eleventh century to the fifteenth century based on recent manuscript discoveries. George Saliba argues that the medieval period, often called a period of decline in Islamic intellectual history, was scientifically speaking, a very productive period in which astronomical theories of the highest order were produced.<br>Based on the most recent manuscript discoveries, this book broadly surveys developments in Arabic planetary theories from the eleventh century to the fifteenth. Taken together, the primary texts and essays assembled in this book reverse traditional beliefs about the rise and fall of Arabic science, demonstrating how the traditional &#x201c;age of decline&#x201d; in Arabic science was indeed a &#x201c;Golden Age&#x201d; as far as astronomy was concerned.<br>Some of the techniques and mathematical theorems developed during this period were identical to those which were employed by Copernicus in developing his own non-Ptolemaic astronomy. Significantly, this volume will shed much-needed light on the conditions under which such theories were developed in medieval Islam. It clearly demonstrates the distinction that was drawn between astronomical activities and astrological ones, and reveals, contrary to common perceptions about medieval Islam, the accommodation that was obviously reached between religion and astronomy, and the degree to which astronomical planetary theories were supported, and at times even financed, by the religious community itself. This in stark contrast to the systematic attacks leveled by the same religious community against astrology.<br>To students of European intellectual history, the book reveals the technical relationship between the astronomy of the Arabs and that of Copernicus. Saliba&#x2019;s definitive work will be of particular interest to historians of Arabic science as well as to historians of medieval and Renaissance European science.</p></p><p>Based on the most recent manuscript discoveries, this book broadly surveys development sin Arabic planetary theories from the eleventh century to the fifteenth.

This volume looks at the subject of forestry, concentrating on the identification of Eastern North America trees. &#34;The Forester&#39;s Manual&#34; will appeal to those with an interest in forestry and is not to be missed by collectors of vintage scouting literature. Ernest Thompson Seton (1860 - 1946) was an English author and wildlife artist who founded the Woodcraft Indians in 1902. He was also among the founding members of the Boy Scouts of America, established in 1910. He wrote profusely on this subject, the most notable of his scouting literature including &#34;The Birch Bark Roll&#34; and the &#34;Boy Scout Handbook.&#34; Seton was also an early pioneer of animal fiction writing, and he is fondly remembered for his charming book &#34;Wild Animals I Have Known&#34; (1898). Other notable works by this author include: &#34;Lobo, Rag and Vixen&#34; (1899), &#34;Two Little Savages&#34; (1903), and &#34;Animal Heroes&#34; (1911). Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive.

Painted in the Suprematist and Constructivist style of early twentieth-century Russian avant-garde masters, the 181 canvases had been acquired by amateur collectors Ron and Roger Pollard from a mysterious seller in Germany they met on eBay who claimed the paintings were found in an abandoned shipping container held in German customs since the 1980s. In <em>From Russia with Doubt</em>, Lerner skillfully weaves together the tale&#x2014;from the initial eBay find to his controversial decision to exhibit the collection&#x2014;guiding readers through the looking glass into the Byzantine corridors of the art world and beyond, describing the owners' quest to authenticate and appraise the would-be masterpieces. What he finds raises powerful questions about our own relationship to art.</p><p>Adam Lerner is Director and Chief Animator at MCA Denver"Adam Lerner's story of this improbable collection is an amusing yet sneakily profound ditty about the alchemical nature of what makes art Art." - Barnaby Furnas, artist<br><br>"The story of Ron, Roger, and their Russian paintings reads like an outrageously surreal novel about the international art world co-written by Franz Kafka and John le Carr�. Adam Lerner's enormously entertaining book takes us deep into a world of art forgery where ex-communist spies meet art aficionados to trade Russian avant-garde paintings over the Internet." - Jens Hoffmann, deputy director, Jewish Museum, New York<br><br>"The book reads like a great thriller.... It's also a beautiful meditation on what defines the authenticity of art." - The Paris Review blog<br><br>"An incredible story. Adam Lerner's book beautifully illuminates the mysterious possibility of objects and the people and histories they connect us to.

The appointment of Randolph Gunderson as U.S. attorney general adds to rumors about his financial association with city mobsters, suspected of torching Gunderson's unprofitable buildings. Although Cassella is frankly amoral, he is outraged by the alleged crimes of the new presidential cabinet member and goes looking for facts to back the rumors. The investigation takes the detective to the nation's capitol, to Florida and even to France, and into colorful company that includes amorous women, a shady U.S. senator, an unfrocked priest, profit-hungry media evangelists and Cassella's gangster kin. Trusting in ends that justify means, the detective plunges into the most foolhardy betrayal of his dicey life. The resolution is virtually guaranteed to confirm Beinhart's standing as an extraordinarily gifted author, no more afraid to take daring chances than his tarnished hero. This is a remarkable achievement, with nonstop frights contrasted by uproariously funny incidents and the 20/20 dialogue that personalizes the widely different characters. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild and Mystery Book club alternates. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Compass American Guides: Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks (Full-color Travel Guide)</h2><p>Written by locals, Fodor's travel guides have been offering expert advice for all tastes and budgets for 80 years. <br><br>America's first national park, Yellowstone contains an incomparable combination of natural beauty, rugged wilderness, and abundant wildlife.
